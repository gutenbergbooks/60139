<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Our</span> engraving presents
a view of the Navy-Yard,
taken from a point
of view below the city of Philadelphia. From this
yard have come some of the best sailing and steam-vessels
that have ever been built for Uncle Sam.
The largest vessel that ever floated upon our waters,
“The Pennsylvania,” was built here. She is useless,
and is most scandalously given over—we believe, as
a sort of “receiving ship,” and is rotting ingloriously.
She should have been sent to the “World’s Fair”
by Congress, filled with American products, and the
Arts of Peace. But Congress was <span class='it'>busy</span>—talking
about the “dissolution of the Union”—<span class='it'>Pshaw!</span>—and
had no time for <span class='it'>national</span> business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have no inclination to talk much about Navy-yards
since we read the following. We give you
<span class='it'>the picture</span>, reader—but give us a cheaper postage
upon Newspapers and Books, and fewer Soldiers
and Naval Commanders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Victor Hugo estimates the annual cost of maintaining
the standing armies of Europe at five hundred
millions of dollars. This outlay would, in a
very few years, pay off every national debt of
Europe. In a few years more it would, if wisely
expended, so equalize the population of the globe,
by a great system of emigration, that every man
might have a fair opportunity to earn a competence
by his labor. Mr. Upham, in his ‘Manual of Peace,’
thus classifies the causes of the wars of Europe since
the age of Constantine the Great—that is, since the
Christian religion became the prevailing one: wars
of ambition, forty-four; of plunder, twenty-two; of
retaliation, twenty-four; of honor, eight; of disputed
territory, six; of disputed titles to crowns,
<span class='it'>forty-one</span>; of alliances, thirty; of jealousy, twenty-three;
of commerce, <span class='it'>five</span>; civil wars, fifty-five; of
religion, twenty-eight: total, two hundred and
eighty-six. The national debt of England, caused
by wars alone, is equal to about one-ninth of the
whole property of the United Kingdom. The cost
of maintaining the war establishments of Europe
and the United States is fifty-four per cent. of the
whole revenue of the nations. Of the revenue of
the Austrian government, thirty-three per cent. is
expended in maintaining the army and navy; France,
thirty-eight per cent.; Russia, forty-four per cent.;
Great Britain, seventy-four per cent.; <span class='it'>the United
States, eighty per cent</span>.” Uncle Sam should take a
fresh look at his figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Like</span> auriferous deposits in common quartz, the
readers of <span class='sc'>Graham</span>, the precious ore amidst duller
literary encompassment, brighten the continent from
Canada even to California. A few rich veins are to
be found in large cities, but the valuable aggregate
is scattered through the more rural portion of the
country, where the free air whistles by, uncontaminated
by the smoke of thousands of chimneys, and
where night reigns in sable supremacy, and is not
turned into decrepit day by blazing gas and brilliant
illuminations. The great mass of Grahamites are,
therefore, but slightly versed in the etiquette of
towns, and know little of city follies and city pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In farm-houses midst pleasant valleys, in log-cabins
which dot clearings midst western prairies, even in
the unsubstantial tents of seekers in El Dorado, they
turn to its pages for amusement, moral cultivation
and instruction. These demands have been often
attended to, though perhaps a trifle too gravely.
The time has at length come, when the growing
public taste bids us prepare to have a little fun.
Human folly is the best and most natural subject for
human ridicule. To laugh with the manes of the
Jolly old Grecian philosopher, is more agreeable than
to snivel with the lugubrious ghost of his weeping
rival. We therefore must needs have a hearty guffaw
together, and as the most appropriate subject for
mirth, suppose we select that incarnation of vapid
creation, but that idol of self-esteem—<span class='sc'>a City Dandy</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The assertion made by the ancient sage Socrates,
that “a dandy is like a jackass, because he wears his
Sunday-coat every day,” would scarcely fit a modern
exquisite, whose diurnal attire varies with each revolution
of the sun. The apothegm of Plato, that “a
monkey owes his distinction to his tail and a fop to
his tailor,” is not thoroughly apt, because the human
ape owes something (generally a considerable sum)
to his hatter and boot-maker. The well-known assertion
of Virgil, “<span class='it'>in squirtibus nihil sed aquæ lactissimus</span>”—in
squirts you will find nothing but milk
and water—has about it the usual license taken by
poets, inasmuch as if we examine <span class='it'>our</span> squirts, they
will be pronounced empty. Bacon’s celebrated
maxim in his Novum Organum, that “what are considered
petty matters are often of importance, but
there is no importance in a <span class='it'>petit maître</span>,” will probably
be acquiesced in by common people, though
those implicated by the serious pun may think it uncommonly
impudent. Newton’s position taken in
the <span class='it'>Principia</span>, that “in apples and men there is
much specific gravity, but mushrooms and dandies
are of trifling lightness,” may be disputed by the
latter, who with some show might liken their weight
to that of “some pumpkins.” Euclid’s celebrated
rule, “a plane superficies is every where flat, <span class='it'>e.g.</span> a
dandy who is plainly superficial is a flat every
where,” has long been a fixture in geometrical lore,
which may be doubted, though dangerous to dissent
from. We, therefore, seek in vain in the lessons of
ancient science and wisdom for competent authority
to settle the question—“What is a dandy?” <span class='it'>Hamlet</span>,
who being the “glass of fashion and the mould
of form,” was of course a fop, did on one occasion
confess that himself and some other leaders of the
ton at that time, yclept <span class='it'>Horatio</span> and <span class='it'>Marcellus</span>, were
“fools of nature,” and horribly shook their dispositions
“with thoughts beyond the reaches of their
souls.” His candid admission that exquisites are
natural fools—“rather weak in the upper story,” and
unable to stand the overpowering weight of grave
thought—has long been admired as a fine picture of
the mental condition of the dandies when something
was “rotten in the state of Denmark.” But even
this idea of the immortal bard will scarcely assimilate
to a proper notion of our modern bucks, because
the foppery natural to a Hamlet would not be similar
to that of a large City.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We therefore rummage
the books with little success
in search for authorities
upon this subject.
We are constrained to a
belief that Linnæus has
not classified the <span class='it'>genera</span>
or Buffon discriminated
the species. If exquisites,
by reason of their
sappiness, are vegetable,
the Swedish naturalist
has passed over the variety—if
they are animals,
the Frenchman has
not given them a proper
place among the <span class='it'>mammalia</span>.
The history,
habits and peculiarities
of these mandrakes, these
“forked radishes,” these
nondescripts, who afflict
the south side of Chestnut
street, Philadelphia, or
the west side of Broadway,
New York, has not yet been written, but the
subject has latterly assumed an importance which
can be no longer disregarded. If the comic dissector,
with scalpel in hand, were to desire the fop for a
subject, he would have to wait until he was defunct,
but the dandy never dies; he is a living example of
the verity of the adage, true whenever made—“the
fools are not all dead yet”—and it is therefore impossible
to imagine the time when there will not be a
dandy. We cannot consequently dissect. We may
apply the stethoscope to the chest of the exquisite;
we may feel his weak pulse, or examine his silly
tongue. So may we make our diagnosis, and though
we cannot “minister to a mind diseased,” we may,
at least, “hold the mirror up to nature,” for the benefit
of all gazers. Therefore, in pursuance of the
task, come we to our first great inquiry:</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>HOW ARE DANDIES MADE?</h2>

<p class='pindent'>This is a grave question, for fops are like veal pies—in
the opinion of the waggish Weller—the crust
may be rather respectable, but the making up of the
interior is “werry duberous.” Exquisites at this
present writing, are a conglomeration of lanky legs,
hairy heads and creamy countenances. Such are
their natural peculiarities. But it is evident that in
considering this subject, the great topic of inquiry is,
What is a dandy sartorially? Here description will
proclaim him to be a being stuck into tight trowsers,
ditto coat and vest, ditto boots, not so much ditto
overcoat, and crowned with a cylindrical structure of
felt, which is called a hat. Mentally the subject of
dandyism offers little field for remark, because the
weakness which distinguishes the unfortunate class
of our fellow citizens now under consideration, is
caused by natural imbecility and want of common
sense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a topic of inquiry worthy of the most acute
philosophical research whether buckishness is a natural
or acquired folly. Some who have argued upon
the matter have taken the ground, that all such vanities
are the consequence of the great fall, and that as
the expulsion from Eden was followed by the assumption
of apparel, good Mother Eve was tempted and
overcome by the fascinations of dress. For support
of this view of the subject it may be urged, that with
the fall came dress, with dress came fashion, and
with fashion came the Dandy. Others suggest that
such an argument as this, going back beyond the
flood, is far-fetched, and they profess to be able to
assign a much better cause for dandyism. According
to these philosophers every fop has “a soft place
in his head,” which has been very beautifully described
by the poet as</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>They affirm that this weak portion of a skull otherwise
thick, is the chosen place of the “organ of dandyism,”
and controls the habits of its possessors. If
this were so, we might pardon a failing which cannot
be remedied, but, with Combe in our hands, we
in vain run over the head to find this organ, which is
certainly not a hand-organ. None of the phrenological
authorities—it is a striking fact—give the locality
of this bump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No; “the milk of human kindness” which was
“poured into Gall,” forbade him from making known
the situation of the protuberance, and Fowler unfairly
dodges the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing is to be made out of this inquiry, and after
considering the matter with great gravity, we are
driven to the conclusion that Dandyism is like a bad
cold, caught nobody knows how, or when, or where,
or why. Some may be afflicted because they have the
pores of vanity open—others who sit in the draught of
affectation, may suddenly be seized by a fashionable
influenza—going suddenly from the warm room of
common sense into the cold air of ostentation, may
give the “<span class='it'>grippe</span>” to some—but with many it is
chronic, having been acquired in childhood when
their dear mammas tricked them out in fantastic velvets
and fine caps, with feathers, making them juvenile
dandies among the little boys of their neighborhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all this may be tiresome to the reader who desires
to plunge at once in the middle of the subject.
We must really get on with this important theme,
and responding categorically to the inquiry, “how
dandies are made?” respond: by eight honest mechanics,
to wit, the tailor, hatter, boot-maker, linen-draper,
haberdasher, glover, hosier and jeweler.
Take away the articles fabricated by these men, what
is he but a helpless mortal, a mere man and terribly
unfashionable? We might once have added to the
list of dandy manufacturers the barber—but our modern
exquisites have so little to do with that artist
that the claims of Figaro to the distinction would be
strongly controverted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An inspection of a buck in this month of February,
anno domini eighteen hundred and fifty-two, will
convey to the mind of the spectator ideas of a pair
of very thin legs, surmounted by a very short specimen
of an overcoat, with monstrous buttons and wide
sleeves—a cravat with a bow about six inches wide
and three inches broad, with fringes at the ends—a
standing shirt collar, running up to a very sharp point—something
like a face, covered with hair over
what, in Christians, are the chin, cheek and upper-lip—and
a hat thereon. Simile fails in ability to
convey any adequate notion of this figure. Two
pipes, bowl downward and stems upward, might
give an idea of the lower extremity of the dandy.
We will carry out the nicotian metaphor by placing
on the upper portions of the stems a paper of “Mrs.
Miller’s best”—the short-cut, oozing from the top of
the torn paper, will do very well for the hair on the
face—a tobacco-box placed on the whole, will give
some idea of a figure, which, if greatly magnified,
would in the outline much resemble a modern fop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clothing of an exquisite is a work of time and
science. We can imagine how much of the labor
is done. But there are two subjects, in the making
of a fop, that have long been considered puzzles.
One of these questions is—how does he manage to
tie those huge bows in his cravat, which stand out
just below his chin, giving him thereabout the appearance
of a cherubim, all head and wings? What
a work of fixing must there be before he gets the
knot exactly right! What gazing into the mirror—what
pulling of ends—what twisting of folds—what
tying and untying! Every thing must be just so.
There must be no wrinkles—all must be smooth and
“ship-shape,” or the dandy so remiss upon this
subject would be avoided forever by his associates.
It has been asserted that a smart exquisite is able to
tie his cravat in half an hour, but the general average
of time is believed to be an hour and a half. There
is a melancholy instance on record, of a fop who
once took three hours to fix the bow of his cravat.
The sad occurrence took place on what should have
been his wedding-day. He commenced the work
at seven o’clock in the morning and had “a nice
knot” at ten. Unfortunately, the hour of the wedding
was fixed at nine. The anxious intended
wailed impatiently at the altar for her expected
lord, for half an hour, and then concluding that he
meant to insult her, went away in a huff, so that the
unfortunate dandy, by being too particular as to
tying a nice knot, lost the opportunity of fastening a
nicer knot, and worse still, a bride “worth a hundred
thousand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This inquiry into the time occupied at the cravat,
though very interesting, must yield in importance to
another, to wit:—How do dandies get into their
boots?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In former years this puzzling topic could not have
arisen. Loose trowsers gave plenty of room to boots
which were wide in the legs. There was no difficulty
in getting heels into them, and though there
might have been some screwing and stamping, it
was certain that eventually the articles would be
drawn on the feet. Then, too, the tightness was only
in the foot part of the boot. It required considerable
muscular exertion to coax the five toes into the close
prison designed for them, but by pulling one moment,
working the foot the next, and then screwing the
face into ugly contortions, considerable progress was
usually effected. The power of the human countenance
over upper leather is one of those extraordinary
psychological facts which dabblers in animal magnetism
have failed in accounting for satisfactorily.
Yet that it does exist, is vouched for by all experience.
Tight boots have always been susceptible
to this influence. History herself cannot point
to an instance where a new leathern foot-envelope
was drawn on the walker with a countenance
“calm as a summer’s morning.” It is notorious
that no boot of character ever yielded until it saw,
from the knitting of the eyebrows, the puckering of
lips, and the distortion of muscles, that the putter-on
was in absolute earnest. And how stubbornly the
leather yields when it comes under the influence—how
it relaxes with stiff dissatisfaction, and at last
creeps over the part assigned, with an air of unwrinkled
disgust. The philosophy of this subject is
strange, and should be investigated by some modern
Mesmer of sole and upper leather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But really this is a digression, which the importance
of the correlative subject has drawn us into.
“Let us return to our—mutton.” (We might have
said our <span class='it'>veal</span>, were it not that the idea of dandies’
legs and calves are incongruous and unnatural.)
It is an inflexible rule in the making up of an exquisite,
that there shall be no calves to his legs.
The mere osteological peculiarities of that part of
the frame are to be preserved, and the epidermis
must clasp the attenuated limb, without embracing
a superfluity of muscle similar to that which we see
in the lower limbs of the statues of Hercules.
Hence it follows that the heel of a true dandy is expected
to protrude an inch at least beyond what,
under happier circumstances, would be the calf of
his leg. There is really no difference between the
formation of the lower pedalities of a pure dandy,
and those of a pure Ethiopian. In this anatomical
fact lies the great difficulty in the way of modern
“squirts.” The heel unfortunately requires a greater
opening at the top of the boot than can be filled up
by the upper part of the leg when the article is upon
the foot. This is a very distressing difficulty. The
pantaloons are expected to hug the leg as tightly as
possible, so that the thinness of the “trotters” may
be revealed in all their natural beauty. But an obstacle
exists in the shape of an inch or two of superfluous
leather at the top of the boot, which will
have a tendency to give the limb an appearance of
greater circumference than nature or fashion permits.
This trouble is really of disgusting importance. How
do the dandies manage, then, to produce those thin
legs, the slightness of which is so strikingly graceful?
The world has long wondered over this subject,
and it was not until lately that a true philosopher
revealed the mystery. He asserts that after fops
get into boots and unmentionables, they turn up the
latter until they get a fair purchase on the leather
inconveniencies. Then, with broad bandages they
swathe their legs and the upper part of their boots
quite carefully, until the superfluous leather is bound
tightly down, and there is a comparatively smooth
surface all the way down the limb. After having
got his trowsers pulled down, the fop is ready for a
promenade upon Chestnut street, or a conquest in a
drawing-room. In the former exercise he gets along
as well as can be expected, being very careful in his
mincing steps lest an unlucky rip should damage
the integrity of his apparel. In the latter situation
he is often put to great inconvenience. When sitting
down, the unwhisperables are, by the disposition
of his body, drawn a considerable distance above
the ankle. To get them down again is a matter which
no thorough dandy can accomplish. If he were to
bend to do it, the consequence would be disastrous.
He therefore takes his leave of the ladies with pantaloons
half-way up to the knee, and, stopping in the
entry, exclaims—“Wait-ah! wait-ah! hea-ah, fell-ah,
assist me! Come hea-ah and pull down my
pants! Really, ah, they-ah have risen until they
are quite uncomfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus much for the present division of our task,
from which we draw the deduction that every exquisite
has his troubles like plainer people. One day
he may be in agonies because his cravat is not decently
tied. On another he may be in torture because,
notwithstanding all his efforts, his legs seem
thick. These and other ills are occasional misfortunes.
It is not considered by him that although
these griefs come once in a while, he is at all times
in manners a puppy, and in mental strength only a
ninny.</p>

sun had not lifted a portion of his disc above the
huge, round-topped fells which formed the horizon
to the north and westward of my scene. That scene
was the slope of a long hill—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hills above and somewhat farther off to the
southward and eastward, are clothed and crowned
with oak woods of magnificence and size so unusual,
and kept with such marked evidences of care and
culture that no one could doubt, even if it were not
proved by the gray turrets of an old baronial manor
and the spire of a tall clock-house shooting up high
over the tops of the forest giants, that they were the
appendages and ornaments of some one of those ancient
homes of England, which, full of the elegancies
and graces of the present, remind us so pleasantly of
the ruder, though not less homely, hospitalities of the
past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The immediate summit of the slope I have mentioned
is bare, yet conspicuous for a single tree, the
only one of its kind existing for many miles in that
district—a single white pine, tall enough for the mast
of some huge admiral, and as such visible, it is said,
from points in the four northern provinces of England,
and the two southernmost of Scotland—whence
it is known far and wide, in many a border lay and
legend, as the one-tree hill on Reedswood.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> Below
the bare brow of this inland promontory, for such indeed
it is, which is covered with beautiful, short,
mossy grass, as firm and soft as the greensward of a
modern race-course, and used as one vast pasture of
two hundred acres, lies a vast tract of coppice, principally
of oak and birch, but interspersed with expanses
of waving heather, where the soil is too shallow
to support a larger growth, and dotted here and
there with bold, gray crags which have cropped out
above the surface, and amongst these, few and far
between, some glorious old, gnarled hawthorns,
which may well have furnished May-wreaths to the
yellow-haired daughters of the Saxon before the
mailed-foot of the imperious Norman had dinted the
green turf of England. This coppice overspread the
whole declivity and base of the hill, until it melted
into the broad, rich meadows, which, with a few
scattered woods of small size, and here and there a
patch of yellow wheat, or a fragrant bean-field, filled
all the bottom of the great strath or valley, down to
the banks of a large stream, beyond which the land
rose steeply, first in rough moorland pastures, divided
by dry stone walls, then in round heathery
swells, then in great, broad-backed purple fells, and
beyond all, faintly traceable in the blue haze of distance,
in the vast ridges of the Cheviots and the hills
of Tevydale. Along the base of the hill-side, parting it
from the meadows, ran a tall, oak park-paling, made of
rudely split planks, not any where less than five feet in
height, through which access was given to the valley
by heavy gates of the same material, from two or
three winding wood-roads into the shadowy lanes of
the lovely lower country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the scene, o’er which there arose before
the sun, startling the hill echoes far and near, and
silencing the grouse-cocks on the moors, and the
song-birds in the brake and thicket by their tumultuous
din, the shouts and fanfares that told the hunt
was up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tayho! Tayho!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tarà-tarà-tara-tantara-râ-taratantara-tantara-rà-rà-râh.
Which being interpreted into verbal dog-talk
is conceived to say—“Gone-away! gone-away!
gone-away! away! away! away!” and is immediately
understood as such not by the well-mounted
sportsmen only, but by what Scott calls, himself no
unskilled woodsman, “the dauntless trackers of the
deer,” who rush full-mouthed to the cheery clangor,
filling all earth and ether with the musical discords
of their sweet chidings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spot whence the first loud, manly shout “Tayho”
resounded, was almost within the shadow of the
one tree, where, as from a station commanding the
whole view of the covert, which a powerful pack of
the famous Talbot blood-hounds, numbering not less
than forty couple, were in the act of drawing, a gay
group was collected, gallantly appareled, gallantly
mounted, and all intent, like the noble steeds they
bestrode, eyes, ears and souls erect on the gallant
sport of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those were the days of broad-leaved hats and
floating plumes, of velvet justaucorps, rich on the
seams with embroideries of gold and silver, of the
martial jack-boot and the knightly spur on the heel,
and the knightly sword on the thigh, and thus were
our bold foresters accoutred for such a chase as is
never heard tell of in these times of racing hounds
and flying thoroughbreds, when the life of a fox is
counted by the minutes he can live with a breast-high
scent before the flyers, and the value of a hunter
by the seconds he can go in the first flight with a
dozen horseman’s stone upon its back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Things then were otherwise, the fox was unkenneled,
or the stag unharbored at daybreak, and
killed if the scent lay well, sooner or later, before
sunset—runs were reckoned by hours, hounds picked
for their staunchness not their fleetness, horses
bought not for their speed but for their stoutness, and
the longest, steadiest last rider, not the most daring
or the foremost won the palm of the chase, were it
brush or antler, when the game fox was run into, or
the gallant stag turned to bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gentlemen, who were gathered on the broad,
bare brow of the one-tree hill, were in all, twelve or
thirteen in number, all at first sight men of gentle
blood and generous education, although as there ever
is, ever must be in every company, whether of men
or of inferior animals, there was one to whom every
eye, even of the unknown stranger or the ignorant
peasant, would have naturally turned as evidently
and undoubtedly the superior of the party, both in
birth and breeding; he mingled nevertheless with the
rest on the most perfect terms not of equality only,
but of intimate familiar intercourse and friendship.
No terms of ceremonial, no titles of rank or territorial
influence, but simple Christian names passed
between those gay and joyous youths; nor was there
any thing in the habit of the wearers, or the mounting
of the riders, to indicate the slightest difference
in their positions of social well-being and well-doing.
One youth, however, who answered to the name of
Gerald, and sometimes to the patrimonial Howard,
was so far the handsomer both in form and feature,
the statelier in stature, the gracefuller in gesture, the
manlier in bearing, the firmer and easier of seat and
hand on his hunter, that any one would have been
prompt to say almost at a glance, there is the man
of all this gentle and generous group, whom, if war
wakes its clangor in the land, if external perils
threaten its coasts, or internal troubles shake its state,
foreign war or domestic strife will alike find the
foremost, whether in his seat with the senate, or in
his saddle on the field, wielding with equal force
and skill the stateman’s, scholar’s, soldier’s eye,
tongue, sword—all honored him, indeed, and he deserved
that all should honor him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have omitted, not forgotten or neglected, to mention
as first and fairest of that fair company, a bevy
of half a dozen fair and graceful girls—not like the
gentlemen, all of one caste, but as was evident, not
so much from the difference of their grace and
beauty—though in these also there was a difference—as
from the relative difference of position which
they maintained, four remaining somewhat in the
rear of the other two, and not mingling unless first
addressed in the conversation, and from some distinction
in the costliness and material of their attire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mounted chamberlain, with four or five grooms,
who stood still farther aloof, in the rear of the ladies
in waiting, and two or three glittering pages standing
a-foot among the latter, in full tide of gallantry
and flirtation, their coursers held by the grooms in
attendance, made up the party. From which must
always be excepted the huntsman, the verdurer, and
eight or ten yeomen prickers, in laced green jerkins,
with round velvet caps, like those worn by the
whippers-in of the present day, and huge French-horns
over their left shoulders, who were seen from
time to time appearing, disappearing, and reappearing
in the glades and dingles of the hill-side covert,
and heard now rating the untimely and fallacious
challenge of some wayward and willful puppy, now
cheering the earnest and trusty whimper of some redoubted
veteran of the pack, as he half-opened on a
scent of yester-even.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hounds had been in the coppice above an
hour, and two-thirds of its length had already been
drawn blank—the gentlemen were beginning to exchange
anxious and wistful glances, and two or three
had already consulted more than once or twice their
ponderous, old-fashioned repeaters—and now the
elder, shorter and fairer of the two damsels, giving
the whip lightly to her chestnut palfry, cantered up
to the side of Gerald Howard, followed by her companion,
whose dark redundance of half-disheveled
nut-brown tresses fell down from beneath a velvet
cap, with a long drooping plume, on each side of a
face of the most exquisite oval, with a high brow,
long, jet-black eyelashes, showing in cold relief
against her pure, colorless cheeks, for her eyes were
downcast, and an expression of the highest intellect,
which is ever found in woman mingled with all a
woman’s tenderness and softness. She was something
above the middle height, with a figure of rare
slenderness and symmetry, exquisitely rounded, and
sat her horse at once most femininely and most
firmly, without the least indication of manliness in
her seat or demeanor, yet with a certain of-at-homeness
in her position and posture, that showed she
could ride as well, perhaps as boldly, as the best man
among them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Gerald, Gerald,” said the elder girl, laughingly,
as she tapped him on the arm with the silver-butt
of her riding-whip, “is this your faith to fair
ladies, and especially to this fairest Kate, that you
deluded us from our soft beds at this untimely hour,
with promise to unharbor us a stag of ten within so
many minutes, all for the pleasure of our eyes, and
the delectation of our hearts, and here have we been
sitting on this lone hill-side two hours and upward, to
the great craving of our appetites and the faintness
of our hearts, yearning—as the queen’s good Puritans
would have it—after creature comforts—out on
you! out on you, for a false knight, as I believe not,
for my part, that there is one horn or hoof from the
east to the west on the hill-side—no, not from the
‘throstle’s nest’ to the ‘thorny brae.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! sister mine, art so incredulous—but I will
wager you or ere the Talbots reach that great gray
stone, with the birch boughs waving over it like the
plumes, as our bright Kate would say, of a dead
warrior’s helmet over his cold brow, we <span class='it'>will</span> have
a stag a-foot—ay, and a stag of ten.” And instantly
raising his voice to a quicker and clearer note—“See
now!” he cried, “see now!” as a superb, dark-colored
animal, not lower than a yearling colt at the
forehand, leaped with a bound as agile as if he was
aided by wings, on the cope-stone of the dry stone
wall which bounded the hither side of the hill coppice,
with vast, branching antlers tossed as if in defiance,
and a swan-like neck swollen with pride and
anger. He stood there an instant, self-poised, self-balanced,
“like the herald Mercury new lighted on
a heaven-kissing hill”—uttered a hoarse, belling cry,
peculiar to the animal in his season, and then sailing
forth in a long, easy curve, alighted on the springy
turf, whose enameled surface he scarce dinted, and
then swept up the gentle slope almost toward the
admiring group on the brow, but in a diagonally
curved line that would carry him in the long run to
the south-west of them, at the distance of perhaps a
hundred yards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tayho! Tayho!” burst in a clear and cheery
shout from the excited lips of Gerald Howard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And instantly from every part of the hill-side from
east to west, from the throstle’s nest to the “thorny
brae,” from ten well-blown French-horns burst the
wild call Tarà-tarà—tara-tantara-ra—tara-tantara-tantara—ra—ra—rah—“Gone
away—gone away—gone
away—away—away!” and the fierce rally of
the mighty Talbots broke into tongue at once through
the whole breadth and length of the oak coppice, as
they came pouring up the hills, making the heather
bend and the coppice crash before them like those
famed Spartan hounds of Hercules and Cadmus,</p>

<p class='noindent'>As fifty separate spots they leaped the wall nearly
abreast, but four were it may be a spear’s length the
leaders, and they laying their head right at the noble
quarry, which was still full in view, came straining
up the hill, making all ring around them with their
deep-mouthed thunder. The rest topped the wall
one by one, in view too, and on a breast-high scent
at once came streaming up the rich grass slope on
converging lines, so that as they passed the attentive
group to the westward within a hundred yards, the
pack had got all together within, perhaps, another
hundred yards of his haunches, running so that a
large carpet might have covered the whole forty
couple, and raving with such a din of harmonious
discords, such shrill and savage trebles of the fierce
fleet bitch hounds, such a deep diapason of the old
veteran dogs, such sweet and attuned chidings of
the whole, that not an ear but must have listened
with delight, not a heart but must have bounded with
rapture at the exulting sounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And ever and anon there rang up from the wildwood,
the deep, mellow blasts of the French-horns,
blent with the jangled cries of the Talbots into a
strange and indescribable clangor and crepitation, at
once most peculiar and most entrancing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same moment the sun burst into full view
above the eastern hills, and pouring down a great
flood of golden lustre over the whole glowing scene,
kindled up every thing into light and life—tinging
with ruddy light the dappled sides of the noble beast
as he swept by them now within fifty yards—for he
had circled round them wantoning and bounding to
and fro, perfectly unconcerned by the nearer presence
of his pursuers, and seemingly desirous to
display the miracles of his speed and beauty to the
fair eyes that admired him—enlivening the dappled
hides of the many-colored glossy pack—burnishing
the sleek and satin coats of the noble coursers, till
they glowed with almost metallic splendor—flashing
upon the rich laces, the bright buckles, and the
polished sword-hilts of the hunters, and gilding the
bridle-bits and brazen horns of the verdurers and
yeomen prickers, until the whole hill-side was glittering
with a thousand gay hues and salient lights,
filling the mind with memories of faëry land and
magic marvels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitherto the little group on the brow of the one-tree
hill had stood motionless, while the gay, animated
scene revolved around them, a glittering
circle wheeling around the stationary centre; but
now, when the servants of the chase, huntsman and
verdurer, prickers, all streamed up the long hill at
their best pace, all wheeled around the tree and its
gay company, swelling the din with the flare and
braying of their horns, the gallant stag appeared to
comprehend that a fresh band of enemies were
added to his first pursuers—for he half turned his
head to gaze on them, half paused for a moment to
snuff the air, with nostrils pridefully dilated, and
flanks heaving, not with weariness as yet, but with
contempt and scorn, then with a toss of his antlers,
and a loud snort of indignation, set his head fair to
the north-west, full for the hills of Scotland, and went
away at long sweeping bounds that seemed to divide
the green slope by leaps of eight yards each, soared
back again over the rough stone wall, and went
crashing through the thickets straight for the tall
oak palings and the river, as if he were bound for
some distant well-known point, on a right line as
the crow flies it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now for the gentlemen the chase was begun,
and Gerald Howard led it, like their leader as he
was in all things, and the rest followed him like
men as they were, and brave ones—but to the ladies
it was ended so soon as they had breathed their
palfries down the slope to the stone wall and the
wood-side at an easy canter; and they returned to
the hill-top, where they found viands and refreshments
spread on the grass; and long they lingered
there watching the hunt recede, and the sounds of
the chase die away in the far distance. But it was
long ere the sights and sounds were lost all and
wholly to their eyes and ears—for the quarry still
drove on, as straight as the crow flies, due northward—due
northward the chase followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They saw the gallant stag swoop over the oak-pales
as if they were no obstacle—they saw the
yelping pack crash and climb after him; then they
saw Gerald Howard on his tall coal-black barb soar
over it unhindered—but all the rest turned right and
left to gate or gap, or ere they might follow him.
The valley was crossed as by a whirlwind—the
river swam by hart, hound, and hunters, unhesitating
and unheeding—and far beyond up the green moorland
pastures, over the stone walls, now disappearing
over the hill-tops into the misty hollows, now
glinting up again into light over some yet more distant
stretch of purple heath, and still the chiding of
the hounds, and still the wild bursts of the French-horns
fell faintly on the ears, as the wind freshened
from the westward—but at length sound and sight
failed them, and when silence had sunk still and
solitude reigned almost perfect over the late peopled
slope of thorny brae and the one-tree hill, the gay
bevy of dames and damsels returned homeward,
something the more serious if not the sadder for the
parting, to await the gathering of their partners to
the gay evening meal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long they awaited—late it grew—the evening meal
was over—the close of night had come—the lights
in bower and hall were kindled—the gates were
locked and barred—long ere the first of the belated
foresters, returned soiled and splashed, way-worn
and weary, with the jaded and harassed hounds, and
horses almost dead from the exertion and exhaustion
of the day. At midnight, of the field all the men
save one were collected, though two or three came
in on foot, and yet more on borrowed horses—their
own good steeds left in the morass or on the moorland,
to feed the kites and the hill-foxes—of the pack
all save two mustered at the kennel-gates in such
plight as the toil they had borne permitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man missing was Sir Gerald Howard, the
master of the pack, the two hounds were its two
leaders, Hercules and Hard-heart, of whom no rider
had ever yet seen the speed slacken or the heart
fail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old verdurer, who gave out the last, reported
Gerald Howard going well, when he saw him last,
with the stag and two Talbots of all in full view—and
this many miles into Scotland within the
pleasant vale of Teviotdale, with the great Scottish
hills grim and gray, towering up before him, and the
night closing fast on those dim solitudes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late on the next day when Sir Gerald
Howard was seen riding up the road on the same
steed he had backed so gallantly, still weary and
worn, though recruited—with the huge antlers at
his saddle-bow, but no brave Talbots at his heel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had ridden far into the darkness, still guided
by the baying of the staunch hounds; and when he
could see to ride no longer, had obtained timely
succor and refreshment from a stout borderer of
Teviot-side. At daylight remounted a fresh horse, a
garron of the country, to renew the chase; but it was
now soon ended. Scarce had he gone a mile on the
straight line they had run throughout ere he found
Hard-heart stiff and cold on the mountain heather,
and not a hundred yards yet onward, ere the great
stag lay before him, not a hair of his hide injured,
and Hercules beside him, with his head upon his
haunches, where he had breathed his last, powerless
to blood the brave quarry he had so nobly conquered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sixty miles had they run on that summer’s day
from point, they had died together, and in their
graves they were not confounded, for a double tomb
was scooped in the corrie or hollow of the mountain-side,
wherein they were found, and above it was
piled a rough, gray column, whereon may be seen
rudely sculptured this true epitaph,</p>

has gone out of the starry skies which bended over
us in youth, and the dun clouds surge up from the
horizon, and grow heavier and blacker as we muse—the
Present is dreary! We turn back with memory,
and over all the Past we wander. We remember the
snug cottage nestled in the hills—the crackling faggots
on the old hearth-stone—they have their young
vivacity now, and the whole picture of our youthful
home in this beautiful cloud-land rises gradually
and expands before us. Faces all rosy
with the light of the Immortals appear and
vanish—bright wings of angels flash and fade
to the view—and as the scene swells to our
mental vision, the old familiar tones of the old
familiar lips ring out their silver syllables again.
We listen to the joyous laugh, as to the gushing
of music, and almost feel the presence of soft
hands in ours. The glad, beaming face of the
young creature we first worshiped, with all the
innocence of love’s first delusion, sparkles with
the radiant beauty of those happy hours. The
mother in that quiet chamber, with the dim
lamp and the snowy curtains gleaming out
from the corner, where we knelt at her side
and uttered the evening prayer, lifts her white
hands to our brow again, and says, “God bless
and keep thee, my boy!” God help us now—how
have we wandered since our souls felt that
earnest benediction!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Winter is here! and the long, stormy nights
have come, Jeremy—the nights of dread and
desolation to the poor. The roar of the tempest
has the voice of a demon out there! Do the
moan and the howl, which sound so fearfully
now, stir in the heart a thought of the perishing
ones, who, in the midst of this splendid city,
sit shivering, ragged, and starved? The pale
brow and the hollow eye of the consumptive
mother, sitting desolate amid her famishing ones,
grow paler and sadder as the storm rolls on!
Does her low wail of agony reach the ears of angels
to-night? If not—God help her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scores of Christian churches stand grandly out in
the storm, and bravely defy the tempest. They
are tenantless, now, of the rosy lips and bright eyes
which have looked appealingly to Heaven, and muttered
prayers for the poor. Are willing hands employed
to-night in confirmation of the Sunday’s
sincerity? Or do cards, the piano, or the dance, lend
a sorry confirmation of the utter hollowness of
words? Is all the wealth and splendor of Gothic
steeples and stained-glass—the majestic column—the
lordly porch, and the sweeping aisle, but the
magnificence of delusion?—mere monuments of
the wickedness of man endeavoring to cheat the
Creator with tinsel—with show, not worth—with
words, not deeds! God help the homeless,
Jeremy, where this is true! And help the disciple,
too, who prays, but never <span class='it'>thinks</span>! God bless the
humble Christian, who <span class='it'>labors</span> and cares for <span style='font-size:smaller'>THE
POOR</span>!</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>FIRST LOVE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> poor little girl by my side made no struggle
to quit me, no effort to return to her mother, but ran
along holding my hand, with perfect docility and
confidence, weeping bitterly, it is true, and never
uttering a word. It was a strange situation for a
boy of twelve years of age, and yet I felt a certain
sort of pride in it—in the trust which was reposed in
me—in the right, and, as I fancied, the power of
protecting. I would have fought for that little girl
to the death, if any one had attempted to molest her;
and although I had never at that time heard of paladins
and knights-errant, I was quite as valiant in my
own opinion as any one of them ever was. I was
not very hard-hearted at that time—youth seldom
is—and I felt greatly moved by the poor child’s
grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After we had gone about a mile, at a very quick
pace, I began to slacken my speed, and to try and
comfort my little companion. At first she appeared inconsolable,
but by trying hard, I at length made some
impression—won her mind away from the terrors and
sorrows of her situation, and got her to speak a word
or two in reply to my question. She told me that
her name was Mariette, and that she had walked some
way that day—that her mother had rushed into the
room where she was playing, all covered with blood,
as I had seen her just before—had caught her up in
her arms, and rushed out of a château where they
lived, by a back way, plunging at once into the wood.
They had then walked a long distance, she said, her
mother sometimes carrying her, sometimes letting
her run by her side; and I could perceive that, delicately
nurtured and unaccustomed to hard exercise,
the poor little thing was already considerably tired.
I was a strong, big boy, and so without more ado, I
took her up in my arms and carried her. After
some way, I put her down again, and she walked on
refreshed, and then I carried her again, and then we
sat down upon a bank and rested; and I got her
water from the stream in the hollow of my hand, and
tried to amuse her by telling her stories. But I never
was a good story-teller in all my life, and I did not
succeed very well. All this occupied time, however,
and when we arrived within half a mile of the
town, light was fading fast. This alarmed me; not
that I had any fear of darkness, but it was good
Jeanette’s custom, in the gray of the evening to walk
out through our little garden in the tower, down the
stair-case, the door of which lay on the left-hand
side, and lock the door below. I did not like to
go in by the great gates of the town, both because
the distance was greater, and because I thought some
questions might be asked about Mariette; and I resolved,
at all events, to attempt our private entrance
before I yielded to necessity. I encouraged my
little companion to hurry her steps, by pointing out
the town rising before us, and telling her that if she
made haste, she would in a few minutes be with
Father Bonneville, and he would be so good and
kind to her she could not think. I told her, also, of
good Jeanette, and what a nice creature she was,
and I succeeded in engaging her attention and leading
her on much faster than before. We soon reached
the foot of the hill, climbed the steep little path which
led to the door at the foot of the tower, and with
great joy and some surprise I found it open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now come in, Mariette,” I said, “and don’t be
afraid of the dark; for this stair-case leads to our
garden, and the garden to the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said she was not at all afraid of the dark; that
her papa often made her walk with him in the dark;
and she followed me quite readily, holding tight by
my hand, however.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the garden above we found good old Jeanette,
with her snow-white cap, and her mittens. I found
that she had become anxious at my long absence,
and had abstained from locking the door lest I should
determine to come in that way. Her surprise to see
my little companion, and the state of grotesque
agitation and bustle into which the sight threw her,
I shall never forget. My explanations soon banished
surprise by other emotions. I told all I knew of poor
Mariette’s story as simply as I could, and the good
creature’s heart was instantly touched; the tears
gathered in her eyes, and taking the poor little girl
in her arms, she said, “Come with me, my child—come
with me. Here we will make you a home
where you will be as happy as the day is long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t be happy without papa and mamma,” replied
Mariette, bursting into tears again, and Jeanette,
weeping for company, carried her off into the house,
while I ran down the stairs to lock the door of the
tower. When I entered the house again, I found
that Father Bonneville was out visiting some sick
people, and had been absent for several hours.
Mariette wanted no kind of tendence, however, that
was not given to her by good Jeanette. She put her
pretty little feet in warm water; she gave her a cup
of the thin chocolate which usually formed the good
priest’s supper, and she endeavored, with far greater
skill than mine, to wile away her thoughts from all
that was painful in memory, or her new situation.
Mariette soon began to prattle to her, and leaning
her head upon her shoulder, said she loved her very
much; but then, after a few minutes, the bright
young eyes closed, the little head leaned heavier, and
Jeanette, moving her gently, carried her away to
my small room, and placed her gently in my bed,
“to sleep it out,” as she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About half an hour after, good Father Bonneville
returned, and his face showed evident traces of
sorrow and perplexity. But still my story was to be
told, and it seemed to perplex him still more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know her name?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mariette, Father,” I replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what more, besides Mariette?” he asked;
and as I could give him no information, he made
me describe, as accurately as I could, the appearance
of the lady I had seen. I spoke of her
bright and beautiful eyes, and I described her as very
pale; but the good priest inquired whether she
was tall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes,” I replied; “a good deal taller than
Jeanette.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good priest smiled; for Jeanette was a good
deal below the height of the Medicean Venus, and
she is no giantess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be Madame de Salins,” he murmured,
after a moment’s consideration. “Holy father, have
mercy upon us! Killed Monsieur de Salins, have
they, before his poor wife’s eyes? A better young
man did not exist, nor one who has done more good,
both by his acts and his example.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t you know Mariette, if you saw her,
Father?” I asked; and Jeanette coming in from the
room where the child was at the moment, led the
good Father away to see her. When he came back,
he said no more for some time, but sat thinking, with
his head bent forward, and his eyes half closed.
Then he called Jeanette, and somewhat to my surprise,
gave very strict orders for concealing the fact
of the little girl’s residence in our house. My little
room was to be assigned to her; a large, wide, rather
cheerful, long uninhabited room, up stairs, was to
receive a table, and a few chairs from somewhere
else, and to be made a sort of play-room for her, and
I and Jeanette were to do the very best we could to
make the little prisoner happy, while her existence
was to be kept secret from every one but our three
selves. At the same time he laid the strongest injunctions
upon me to abstain from even hinting to
any one the adventure I had met with in the wood,
and never to call the child Mariette de Salins, but
merely Mariette, or Mariette Brun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now began a new sort of existence for me.
Mariette became, as it were, my property—at least
I looked upon her almost as such. I had carried her
in the forest. I had led her along by the hand. I
had brought her there. She was my little foundling,
and my feelings toward her were as strange as ever
came into the breast of a boy of thirteen. There
was something parental about them. I could almost
have brought myself to believe that I was her
father; and yet I looked upon her very much in the
light of a toy, as grown-up parents will sometimes
do in regard to their children. I was with Mariette
the greater part of every day, playing with her,
amusing her, devising all sorts of games to entertain
her. She soon became very fond of me, and quite
familiar; would sit by the hour with her arms round
my neck, and would tell me little anecdotes of her
own home. A pleasant home it seemed to have
been till the last fearful events occurred, full of harmony,
and peace, and domestic joy. Continually
she seemed to forget the present, in pictures of
brighter hours gone by, but from time to time—especially
at first—a torrent of painful memories would
seem to burst upon her, and the end of the little tale
would be drowned in tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two months passed over in this manner, and little
Mariette seemed quite reconciled to her situation.
With the elasticity of childish hope, she had recovered
all her spirits, and no two young, happy,
innocent things were ever gayer than we were. Her
state of imprisonment, too, was somewhat relaxed;
for, in our own town at least, a lull had come upon
the political storm, which, as every one knows,
came up sobbing, as it were, in fits and starts, like a
south-westerly gale, till the full hurricane blew and
swept every thing before it. After some hesitation,
Father Bonneville permitted her to go out with me
into the garden, and there to play amongst the
shrubs, now, alas! destitute of flowers, for an hour
or two before she went to bed. In the town she was
never seen, and with a sort of prescience, which
was, perhaps, not extraordinary, the good Father
explained to me that it would be wiser to use, as
little as possible, the way out of the town by the
garden and the tower. He treated me with a degree
of confidence and reliance on my intelligence and
discretion, which made me very proud. The agitated
and terrible state of the country, he said, and the
anarchical tendencies which were visible throughout
society in France, had induced a number of the most
wealthy and influential people to seek a refuge in
other lands. Those who had got possession of
power, he continued, were naturally anxious to put
a stop to this emigration, and a system of espionage,
which was well-nigh intolerable, had been established
to check it. The advantage we possessed of
being able to go in and out of the town when we
pleaded, without passing the gales, might be lost to
us by the imprudent use of it; and although two or
three other citizens, whose houses abutted upon
towers of the old wall, had the same facilities, he
knew them to be prudent and well-disposed men,
who were not likely to call attention to themselves
by any incautious act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the door below was unlocked and
locked every morning and evening, it may well be
supposed that I adhered strictly to the good Father’s
directions, and always when I wanted to get out of
the city took the way round by the gates. This was
not very often, indeed, for I had now an object of
interest and entertainment at home, which I had
never had before, and Mariette was all the world to
me for the time. Good Father Bonneville in speaking
of her to me used to call her with a quiet smile
“Tu fille”—thy daughter—and pleasant was it for
me to hear him so name her. Certain it is, what
between one thing and another—the little vanity I
had in her—the selfish feeling of property, so strong
in all children—the pleasant occupation which she
gave to my thoughts, and her own winning and endearing
ways, (for she was full of every sort of wild,
engaging grace,) together with her real sweetness of
disposition, which had something more beautiful and
charming in it than I can describe—certain it is, I
say—I learned before a month was over to love nothing
on all the earth like her. Nay more, amongst
all the passions and objects and pursuits of life I can
recall nothing so strong, so fervent, so deep, as that
pure, calm, boyish love for little Mariette de Salins.
I could dwell upon it, even now, for ever, and from
my heart and soul I believed she returned that affection
as warmly. Two months and a fortnight had
passed by: heavier clouds than ever were beginning
to gather on the political horizon: menaces of foreign
invasion to put down the disorderly spirit which had
manifested itself in the land, roused the indignation
both of those whose passions refused correction, and
those who loved the independence of their country.
The very threat swept away one of the few safeguards
of society which remained in France. There
was a great body of the people who disliked the
thought of anarchy; but a short period of anarchy
seemed to them preferable to the indefinite domination
of foreign soldiers in the land, and multitudes of
these better men were now driven to act with or
submit to the anarchists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could see that Father Bonneville was very much
alarmed, and in much agitation and distress of mind.
I twice saw him count over the money which I had
brought him from Madame de Salins, and looking
up in my face, he said, with a thoughtful air:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I ought to send her away—the time is
past—but I know not really what to do—where
could I put her in England?—who could I send with
her?—how could I let her mother know where she
is to be found? This is a small sum, too, to support
her for any time in England. A hundred and forty-seven
louis! England is a dear country—a very
dear country, as I know. Every thing is thrice the
price that it is here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Youth always argues from its wishes. They form
the goal to which, whatever turns the course may
take, the race is always directed in the end. Father
Bonneville’s words were very painful to me, and I
ventured to strive to persuade him that it would be
better to wait a little: that Mariette was well where
she was: that something might have occurred to
delay Madame de Salins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good Father shook his head, with a sigh, and
he then took a little drawer out of a cabinet, and
counted some forty or fifty gold pieces that were
within. I could see, however, that there were, at
least, three little rolls of thin white paper diapered
by the milling of the coin within, and I knew by
their similarity and size with the one which I had
myself received, that each must contain somewhere
about a hundred louis. To me this was Peru; but
Father Bonneville, who knew better, sighed over it,
and put it back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One very stormy night the wind blew in sharp,
fierce gusts against the front windows, and the rain
pattered hard. The streets were almost deserted,
and utterly unlighted, as they were in those times,
they offered no pleasant promenade on such a night
as that. Suddenly the bell rang, as I was sitting by
Father Bonneville reading, when Mariette was
sound asleep up stairs, and Jeanette was working
away in her kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who can that be?” said Father Bonneville,
turning a little pale. “Stay, Jeanette, stay for a
moment;” and he put away one or two things that
were lying about, and locked the door of the little
cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, it might seem a cruelty to keep any one
waiting at the door even for a minute or two in the
pitiless pelting of the shower; but I forgot to mention
in describing the house, that it, and a neighboring
house, which bent away from the main into a
side street, formed a very obtuse angle, and that between
the two there was a little arched entrance
overshadowing a flight of steps which led to the
good Father’s door. Thus, any visitor was as much
sheltered from the rain on the outside, as if he had
been in the house itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jeanette had, at length, permission to go to the
door, and to tell the truth, both Father Bonneville
and I peeped out to see who was the applicant who
made so late a call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to see Father Bonneville,” said a woman’s
voice, marvelously sweet and pleasant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is your business very pressing, madam?” asked
Jeanette, adding, “it is late, and just the good Father’s
time for going to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Life and death!” said the visitor. “I <span class='it'>must</span> see
him, and see him alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, madam, come in,” was the reply, and at
the same moment Father Bonneville said in a low
tone, but it seemed to me with a happy air, “Leave
me, François. Go to bed, my son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I obeyed at once, and in moving across the passage
to the kitchen for a light, I crossed the visitor,
nearly touching her. All I could see, however, was
that she was tall, dignified in carriage, dressed in
deep black, and wrapped up in a large mantle with a
veil over her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I felt sure that it was Mariette’s mother, and hurrying
away to my new room, which was over the
little archway sheltering the entrance, I shut the door
and gave myself up to a fit of despair. I fancied
that she had come to take my little pet away, to
separate her from me forever, to deprive me of my
property, and I cannot describe in any degree what
I felt. The anguish of that moment was as great
almost as I ever experienced in life. All I did within
the next ten minutes I cannot tell, but one thing I
know I did, which was to sit down and cry like a
great baby. I would have given worlds to have
known what was passing; but I did not listen though
I might have done so easily from the top of my little
stairs. But good Father Bonneville had so early,
so well, and so strongly impressed upon my mind
the duty of avoiding any meanness, that eaves-dropping
seemed to me in those days almost as great a
crime as murder. Indeed it was in somewhat of
that shape that the good Father placed it before my
eyes. “What right,” he said, “has one man to rob
another of his secrets any more than of his money?
They are both his property, and if they are not
given they are stolen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was not very long kept in suspense, however,
for by the time I had got my little coat off, and was
still sitting on the edge of the bed crying, I heard
the lady quit the good Father’s little study, and his
voice speaking as he escorted her toward the door.
I knew that Mariette could not have been awakened,
dressed, and carried off in a quarter of an hour,
and I went to bed and slept with a heart relieved.
It was only a respite, however. Four days after
that good Father Bonneville took an opportunity
when Mariette and I were at play of telling her
that she was that night to go away with her mamma,
and take a long journey. He advised her therefore
not to tire herself, but to keep as quiet as possible
till the evening came, even if she could not lie
down and take a little rest during the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor child’s agitation was extreme. The
idea of seeing her mother evidently gave her great
delight, but the thought of going away from a house
where she had been made so happy, and from a
companion who loved her so much, seemed not
exactly to qualify her joy, but to tear her between
two emotions. Her face was, for an instant, all
smiles and radiant with satisfaction. The next instant,
however, she burst into tears, and snatching
Father Bonneville’s hand she kissed it once or
twice. Then pointing to me, she said, “Cannot I
take him with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good priest shook his head, and soon after left
us to pass the time till the hour of separation came
as best we might. I do not think he knew, and indeed
it would be difficult to make any one comprehend,
who has left the period of early youth far behind
him, what were the feelings of Mariette and
myself. I am very much inclined to believe from
my own remembrances, that the pangs of childhood
are much more severe than most grown persons will
admit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day wore away; night came. Little Mariette
was dressed and prepared, and about nine o’clock
the bell rang. In a moment after the poor child was
in her mother’s arms, and weeping with joy and agitation.
Madame de Salins hardly sat down, however,
and there was a look of hurry and anxiety as well as
of grief in her face which told how much she had
suffered, and how much she expected still to encounter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am somewhat late,” she said, speaking to Father
Bonneville; “for there were two men walking
up and down before the house in which I have been
concealed, and I dared hardly venture out. Let us
lose no time, good Father. Who will show us the
way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Louis, my son, get the lantern,” said the good
Father; and turning to Madame de Salins he added,
“He will show you the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These words first seemed to call the attention of
the lady to myself, and advancing toward me she
embraced me tenderly and with many thanks for the
charge I had taken of her little girl in a moment of
danger and of horror. I felt gratified, but I do not know
that I altogether forgave her for coming to carry off
my little companion, and I was also struggling with
all my might not to show myself so unmanly as to
shed tears; so that I replied somewhat ungracefully
I am afraid. I went away for the lantern, however
and by the direction of good Father Bonneville,
lighted Madame de Salins and Mariette through the
garden, and down the stair-case in the tower. I then
proceeded to open the door for them, almost hoping
that the key might be rusted in the lock so as to prevent
their going. It turned easily enough, however, and
when I opened the door I was startled at seeing the
figure of a man standing at the top of the little path
which led down to the foot of the hill. Madame de
Salins, however, accosted him at once by his name,
and he told her that Peter and Jerome were waiting
down below. The parting moment was now evidently
come, and it seemed as bitter to poor little Mariette as
myself. She threw her arms around me. She held me
tight. She kissed me again and again, and her tears
wetted my cheek. At length, however, she was drawn
away from me, and her mother holding her hand led
her down the hill while the man followed. I looked
after them for a moment or two, till they were nearly
lost in the darkness. Then locked the door, and
turned sadly toward the house.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE FLIGHT.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, how dull and tedious was the passing of the
next month to me. There was a vacancy in all my
thoughts which I cannot describe, a want of object
and of interest, which nothing seemed to supply.
But the dullness of the calm was soon to be succeeded
by the agitation of the storm. The populace, particularly
of the suburb, was becoming more fierce and
unruly every hour. If at any previous period there
had been such a thing as tyranny in France—of which
I knew, and had felt nothing—it must have been the
tyranny of one, far removed from the humble or even
the middle stations of life, and much less terrible than
the tyranny of many, which now came to the door
of every house in the land. There was a butcher
living in the lower part of the town, the terror of his
neighbors, and an object of abhorrence to all good
men. Fierce, licentious, and unprincipled, his courage—the
only good quality he possessed—was the
courage of a tiger. On more than one occasion in
former years good Father Bonneville had had to reprove
him, and it would seem he had not forgotten it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, about a month after Mariette had left us, I
had walked out into the town during Father Bonneville’s
absence from home, and was crossing the
square in front of the great church. On one side of
the square was the best inn in the place, and upon
the steps of that inn were standing several officers of
a dragoon regiment which had lately been quartered
in the town. In the midst of the square, I saw a great
crowd of people moving to and fro, and apparently
busy and agitated. There were muskets amongst the
crowd; for in those days the more ragged and poverty-stricken
a man was, the more certain was he
of having some weapon of offense in his hand; and
amongst the rest, with a red night-cap on his head, and
his shirt sleeves tucked up to the elbow, I could perceive
the great stalwort figure of the butcher I have
mentioned. I saw also, however, other garments
than those of the mere populace. There was the
black gown of a priest in the middle of the crowd,
and as I approached with a faint and fearful heart, I
not only saw that the mob were dragging along a
priest by the arms, but also that he was good Father
Bonneville. I heard shouts too of “up with him!
Hang him up, hang him up! To the spout with
him, to the spout!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officers I have mentioned were standing quietly
looking on, laughing and talking with two or three
of the more respectable citizens. But at the first impulse
I ran toward them, caught the hand of one of
the young soldiers, who seemed to bear a high rank
amongst the others, and whose face was a kindly
one, and with eager and terrified tones exclaimed—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, save him, sir, save him. They are going to
kill the best man in all the town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are they going to hang, boy?” asked one
of the citizens in a tone of assumed indifference; for
few persons ventured in those days to show any
sympathy with the victims of popular fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father Bonneville,” I answered, “Oh it is Father
Bonneville—Save him, save him—pray make
haste!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is, indeed, one of the best men in the world,”
said the gentleman, with a look of deep distress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young officer, however, without more ado,
ran down the steps and plunged into the crowd.
One or two of his companions followed, I saw a sudden
pause in the mob, and heard a great outcry of
voices; some apparently in persuasion, others in
mere brute clamor. A moment after, however,
while the parties seemed still disputing, a squadron
of dragoons came into the square, and their appearance,
though they took no part in what was going on,
seemed to have a great effect upon the mob. A
number of the ragged ruffians dropped off every moment,
some walking away down the street, singing
ribald songs, some coming up to the soldiers, and
speaking a word or two to them as if to show that
they were not afraid, but walking away in the end.
At length, however, I had the satisfaction to see the
young officer emerge from the little crowd that remained,
holding Father Bonneville by the arm,
while another of the dragoon officers walked on the
good priest’s other side. The only one who followed
them was the butcher, and he continued pursuing
them with execration and abuse till they reached
the steps of the inn, in which they lodged the good
Father for the time. The young officer made no reply
to all the ribald language with which he was assailed,
except on the inn steps, where he turned, and
said in a calm tone—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be all very true, but proceed according to
law. If he has refused to take the oath required, he
can and will be punished for it, but you are not to be
the judge, and shall not break the law while I am in
command of this town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus saying, without waiting for any answer, he
walked into the inn, and I ran after Father Bonneville.
The good old man was somewhat out of
breath with the rough handling he had received, but
I could not perceive any traces of fear or great agitation
either in his face or manner. As soon as the
young officer and I entered the back-room in which
he had taken refuge, he held out his hand kindly to
me, but addressed his first words to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have to thank you much, my son,” he said.
“I do believe if you had been two minutes later
those poor misguided people would have hanged
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do believe they would,” replied the officer,
with a smile; “but you have to thank this good lad
for my coming as soon as I did. I did not perceive
what they were about till he told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Louis, thank you,” said Father
Bonneville. “I have had a narrow escape, my son.
Although, God knows, I have never done these people
any harm, and have tried to do them good, yet
they seemed resolved to have my blood. Do you
think it will be safe for me to go now, sir? I have
some sick people to attend upon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young officer besought him however to stay
till the town was more completely quieted, and advised
him even then to betake himself to his own
house, and remain concealed and quiet for a day or
two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knew quite well that Father Bonneville would
not follow this counsel implicitly, and he did not.
He got safely home two or three hours after, and remained
within till nightfall; but then he went out
to visit the sick persons he had named, and on the
following morning was pursuing his usual avocations
as if nothing had happened. It was not long, however,
before he became convinced that such conduct
could only lead to martyrdom, without being of the
slightest benefit to his flock. Death would have been
nothing in his eyes, if by it he could purchase good
to others, but that was not a period at which such sacrifices
would be at all available.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day while he was out, a Sister of Charity
came to the house, and talked long and earnestly
with good Jeanette in the kitchen. I was not present
at their conference, but when the Sister went
away again I saw that the old housekeeper was in
a state of the utmost consternation and grief. The
expression of these passions took a curious form
with her. It seemed as if she could not be still for
one moment. She bustled about the kitchen, as if it
were too small for her energies, took down and put
up again every pot, kettle, saucepan, and spit, at least
a dozen times, gazed into the frying-pan with an objectless
look, and seemed only anxious to spend the
superfluous activity of her body upon something,
while her mind was equally busy with something
else. When Father Bonneville returned, however,
she had a long conference with him, and he seemed
very thoughtful and anxious. At night the Sister of
Charity again returned, and this time she bore a letter
with her. I only know what took place between
her and the good Father by the result; for as soon
as she was gone, he called me into his study, where
Jeanette had been all the time, and I at once saw
that my good old friend and instructor had made up
his mind to some great and important step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Louis,” he said, with a calm but very
grave face, “we have heard very evil news. A persecution
is raging against the ministers of religion,
which must soon reach me if I remain here. They
have already commenced in a town not very far distant,
a practice of tying priests and nuns together,
and drowning them in the river, adding, by the term
they apply to these massacres, impiety to murder.
This good creature and Sister Clara, who has just
been here, both urge me strongly to fly. I should
have hesitated to take such a step, but I find that it
is necessary that you should be removed to another
country as soon as possible. I have no one to send
with you, and I trust I am not biased from my duty
by any mere fears for my own life when I determine
to accompany you myself. I shall still be fulfilling
at least one of the tasks which I have undertaken to
perform, and I sincerely believe it is the one in which
the remains of my life can be most serviceable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then went on to explain to me that he had determined
to pass the next day in the town, and to
make his escape at night. Disguise, he added with
a sigh, would be necessary. But good Jeanette undertook
to procure what was fitting for the occasion,
and good Father Bonneville retired to rest that night
grave and sad, but, apparently, in no degree agitated.
On the following day, a few minutes before noon, a
great mob passed up the street, carrying a bloody
human head upon a pole. They stopped opposite to
the good priest’s house, shouting for him to show
himself, and with a quiet and undismayed air he
walked to an upper window, and looked out. He
was instantly assailed with a torrent of abuse, and I
do not feel at all sure that the mob would not have
sacked the house and put him to death, if it had not
been so near the tiger’s feeding-time. All the lower
classes dined at twelve, and Father Bonneville retiring
from the window as soon as he had shown
himself, the crowd marched on again down the
street with their bloody ensign at their head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing that I remember worthy of notice occurred
during the rest of the day, though Jeanette was in a
good deal of bustle, and went in and out more than
once. Several persons came to see Father Bonneville,
and talked with him for some time; but the day
passed heavily with me, although I will acknowledge
that I felt a good deal of that eager and pleasant
expectation with which youth always looks
forward to change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length night fell; the outer door of the house
was carefully locked; Father Bonneville retired to
his own sleeping-room; I assisted Jeanette to bring
down a pair of somewhat heavy saddle-bags, the one
marked with black paint L. L., the other J. C.
Shortly after I heard a step upon the stairs, and a
gentleman entered the room, whom I did not at first
recognize—and could hardly, for some time, persuade
myself that it was Father Bonneville. <a id='sou'></a>Soutane
and bands, and small black cap, and cocked-hat
were all gone, and he appeared in a straight-cut black
coat, with a small sword by his side. His thin,
white hair, powdered and tied behind, and a round
hat, with a broad band and buckle, on his head. The
effect of this change in costume was to make him
look very much smaller than before. He had seemed
a somewhat portly man in his robes, but now he
looked exceedingly lank and spare, and even his
height seemed diminished. He looked strange and
ill at ease, but showed no indecision, now that his
mind was made up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought of burning my papers,” he said, speaking
to Jeanette, “but I don’t know, ma bonne, that
they contain any thing unworthy of a good Christian
or a good citizen. I shall therefore leave them as
they are, to be examined by those who may take the
trouble. You understand all, Jeanette, that I have
said, and what you are to do, and where I am to
hear from you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jeanette comprehended every thing; but the feelings
of the good creature’s heart were at this time
surging up against her understanding with greater
and greater force every minute. At length, when all
was ready for our departure, she fell upon her knees
at good Father Bonneville’s feet, weeping and kissing
his hand, and begging his blessing. The old man
put his hand upon her head, and with an air of
solemn affection, called down the blessing of God
upon her. Then embracing her kindly, he said,
“You have striven, I know, Jeanette, to be as good
a servant to God as to a mere mortal master. He
deserves more and better service than any of us can
give, but he is contented with less than any of us require,
if it be rendered with a whole heart. Farewell,
my Jeanette—farewell for the present! We
shall meet again soon—I trust—I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good Father took one of the saddle-bags, and
I took the other; Jeanette loading me, moreover,
with a large paper parcel of which she bade me take
great care, hinting at the same time that it contained
sustenance for the good Father and myself which
might be very needful to us on our first night’s journey.
She followed us in tears through the garden in
the tower, and down the stairs to the foot. There
she hugged and kissed me heartily, but she had no
power to speak, and by this time, all the pleasant
fancies in regard to setting out to see new scenes,
and to find new enjoyments, which I had entertained
for a moment or two, had passed away, and nothing
remained but sorrow and regret. We made our
way, not without difficulty, down the little path to
the valley; for the night was as black as crime, and
then walked on along the road by the stream, which,
however, we were obliged to quit soon, in order to
avoid a party of men who had a sort of guard-house
where the two roads met. This was easily done,
however. The river was not very full; for the air
was frosty, but dry, and neither snow nor rain had
fallen for two or three days. Some large stones
served us as well as a bridge, and crossing the meadows
on the other side, we reached the high road
from the town toward Paris without going through
the suburbs. About a quarter of a mile farther upon
this road, we found an elderly man standing with
two horses; and although I could hardly see his face,
I recognized in him an uncle of good Jeanette, who
was accustomed every fortnight to bring poultry to
the house, and who, to say the truth, looked a good
deal younger than his niece. Few words passed between
him and us; the saddle-bags were arranged
on the horses’ backs nearly in silence. Father Bonneville
mounted one, and the good farmer helped me
to mount the other. I had never been upon a horse’s
back in my life before, and the animal upon which
I was perched, though somewhat less than that which
carried Father Bonneville, seemed to me a perfect
elephant. I was awkward enough, and uncomfortable
enough, no doubt, at first, but I soon got accustomed
to my position, and took rather a pleasure
in the ride than not, till we had gone some
eight or nine miles, when I began to feel the usual
inconveniences to which young horsemen are subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A good deal of apprehension was entertained both
by my reverend companion and myself, lest our
flight should be discovered, and immediate pursuit
take place. But we found afterward that such fears
were quite vain, the minds of the people of the town,
especially of the anarchists, were turned by various
events in a direction quite different from Father
Bonneville. They had their mayor to guillotine, and
two or three of the principal inhabitants to throw
into prison, which occupied them satisfactorily for
several days. Father Bonneville’s absence was
never noticed by any but his own immediate parishioners,
who wisely forbore to talk about it till
Jeanette, with a bold policy which did her credit,
judging that our escape had been safely effected,
went up to the municipality, and begged to know
what she was to do, as her master had gone away
several days before, and had not returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile we rode on through that live-long
night, neither directing our course straight toward
Paris, nor to the sea-side. When morning
dawned I was terribly tired and sleepy, and saw all
sorts of unreal things in the twilight—the mere effect,
I suppose, of exhaustion. Father Bonneville had
talked to me from time to time, giving me directions
for my general conduct and demeanor toward
himself. I found that it was his intention to assume
the name of Charlier, and that I was to pass for his
nephew, still retaining the name of Lacy, deprived
of its aristocratic prefix of dé. The name, however,
soon got corrupted by the people of the inns
as we went along, and I passed as young citoyen
Lassi throughout the whole of the rest of our long
journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At daylight, after the first night’s march, we halted
on a piece of uncultivated ground at the side of a
wood, and suffering our horses to crop the grass, of
which they stood in some need, we seated ourselves
on a dry bank under the trees, and made free with
the food which good Jeanette had provided for us.
After I had satisfied my keen appetite, and drunk
some wine out of a flask, I fell into a sound sleep
before I was at all aware what was coming upon
me, nor did I wake till Father Bonneville shook
me gently by the arm, at about one o’clock in
the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We then resumed our journey, having to take the
first very dangerous step after quitting the town, in
entering the busy haunts of men, and exposing ourselves
to the eyes and inquiries of strangers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tall church-tower was soon seen rising before
us, at a considerable distance, and Father Bonneville
took the opportunity of a peasant woman, passing
us on the road, to ascertain the name of the town
to which the church belonged. This gave him the
key to his topography, which he had lost during the
night, and as the town was still full fifteen miles distant,
he determined to stop at any village he found
a few miles ere we reached it, in order to avoid the
stricter examination which was likely to be enforced
in a city. Upon calculating as nearly as our knowledge
of the country enabled us to do, we found that
we had made five-and-thirty miles during the night,
and ten or twelve miles more would put what might
be considered a sufficient distance for the time between
ourselves and our enemies. We jogged on
quietly then, encountering a good number of the
peasantry who were returning from market or fair.
For a part of the way we rode by the side of an old
man who was journeying in the same direction with
ourselves. He had a shrewd, thoughtful, but quiet
eye, and a bland, easy smile, which perhaps might
have made a man well versed in the world doubt his
perfect sincerity, notwithstanding his tall, broad
forehead, and a certain dignity of air that did not bespeak
low cunning. He addressed good Father Bonneville
at once as “Monsieur L’abbé,” but looked
at him several times before he said more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first my old companion did not seem to notice
the epithet he bestowed upon him, but after a few
more words had passed, he inquired somewhat abruptly,
“What made you call me ‘Abbé,’ citizen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your dress,” replied the countryman, “your
manner, and your look. The aristocrat is proud,
because he has always commanded, and thinks he
has a right to command. The peasant is vain, because
God has implanted in every French breast the
notion that each man is equal to his neighbor, whether
he be a fool or a wise man, a scholar or a dunce,
a brave man or a <a id='pal'></a>poltroon, a good man or a knave.
But the teacher of religion has a different look. He
has been accustomed to guide and to exhort, and he
knows that it is not only his right but his duty so to
do. There is, therefore, in him a look of confidence
and authority, very different from the haughtiness
of the one or the vanity of the other I have mentioned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must have thought and studied more than
might have been expected,” said Father Bonneville,
examining him closely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no reason why any man should not
study, and still less why he should not think,” replied
the other. “I have done both, I acknowledge.
There are more sins committed in France every day
than that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And pray where do you live?” asked Father
Bonneville.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come and see,” replied the stranger. “Your
horses seem tired, and I have still some nine miles
to go, but we can ride slowly, and at this next turn
we shall quit the high road, which will be a convenience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Bonneville agreed to the proposal, and we
rode on by the side of our inviter in desultory conversation,
pointed occasionally by references to passing
political events, but generally referring to subjects
altogether indifferent. I was dreadfully tired,
I confess, before we got to the end of our long, slow
journey. At length after two hours’ quiet ride, the
stranger said, “We are coming to my home, where
you will be very welcome, and it is as well for you
to stay there to-night; for there is a grand fête of
Liberty going on in most of the villages round, and
that lady, like most other pagan deities, is very fond
of human sacrifices. Now it does not much matter
whether one is crushed under the wheels of Juggernaut,
or burned by Druids in a basket of wicker-work,
or made to pass through the fire like the children
of those obedient and docile Israelites of old,
or have one’s head chopped off on a little platform
in a public square, before the image of a monstrous
woman, in a red night-cap, and with a spear in her
hand. It does not much matter, I say; but all are
disagreeable, and all are to be avoided by every reasonable
means. You will therefore be better in my
home there, than in any inn in the neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?” asked Father Bonneville, gazing on
before him, in expectation of seeing a farmer’s
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” replied the stranger, pointing to a magnificent
château upon a rising ground near. “You
marvel, I see, and I can guess your inquiry—how I
have contrived to keep possession of my own, when
the universal war-cry through all France is, ‘War
to the Castle, Peace to the Cottage.’ I have not
time for long explanation; but sufficient may be told
briefly. You see this coat of coarse gray cloth. It
is the sign, the key, of my whole life. I too was
bred an ecclesiastic. The death of three elder brothers
put me in possession of that thing upon the
hill. I have unfrocked myself, but I retain my early
habits, and respect my voluntary vows. I remain
in two or three little chambers, while very often
boors revel in the halls of my ancestors. But they
have a shrewd notion that if I were gone they would
not have the means of revelry to as great an extent
as at present—that if my property was confiscated,
it would fall into the hands of worse men than myself;
and so long as I, the master of it, act but as the
steward of it, they are well contented to leave me
alone in my office without bringing my head to the
guillotine, which would be of no use at all to any
one, and without seizing upon my lands, it would
be a great embarrassment to themselves. Moreover,
I have once or twice threatened to resign all
my possessions into the hands of the Commune, and
the very lowest of the people have been those to beseech
me the most earnestly to refrain, knowing
very well that they get a better part of the spoil now
than they otherwise would. Thus I have got a certain
command over them, and I do what I like without
fear of any buzzing rumors, or public denunciations.
The man who denounced me would very
soon find his way to the lantern, and as it is unpleasant
to occupy in darkness the place of a light, with
a rope round one’s neck, people abstain. There are
a hundred people in yonder town who could hang
me to-morrow; but my death would be sure to hang
a hundred of themselves, and therefore I have the
majority on my side. But come, let us go in through
the gates.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We entered the château, leaving our horses in the
care of a laboring man in the court, who seemed not
a bit less respectful to the master of the house than
the servant of any old noble in the ancient days.
This was in itself an anomaly in those times; for
the vain desire of equality had completely perverted
men’s judgments, and they sought not alone to sweep
away the differences created by a long established
social system, but even those fundamental differences
produced by the will of God. I believe, in
those days—amongst a great mass of the people at
least—as much jealous hatred was felt toward superior
intellect as toward superior wealth or superior
station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On passing the doors of the building we found
some ten or twelve men seated in the eating-room
drinking and talking. The master of the house
passed through, nodded to them, called them citizens,
and said, “Make good cheer of it. There is
more where that comes from.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cheerful, good-humored laugh was the reply,
and he walked on up the stairs, leading us to a little
suite of apartments which he reserved for himself,
and where his privacy was respected even by the
rude men who surrounded him. There he left us,
and went out to procure some refreshment for us,
part of which he brought in himself. The rest, with
a considerable quantity of plate, which he seemed to
think in perfect security, notwithstanding open doors
and strange visitors, was brought in by a servant of
the old school, but not in livery. When the man
was gone we <a id='ate'></a>ate and drank and refreshed ourselves,
and a conversation, not only of interest but of importance,
occurred between our entertainer and Father
Bonneville. The former seemed to comprehend
our situation, or at least as much of it as was necessary,
without any explanation; and he gave a great
deal of very good and minute advice as to our conduct
while traveling through France. He advised
the good Father, strongly, to put on a brown coat,
saying that the reputation of an abbé was worse than
that of a priest. He advised him also to give up the
plan of traveling on horseback, and betake himself to
a <span class='it'>chaise de poste</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t ask where you are going, or what you
intend to do, but by coming with post-horses, and
lodging at the post-house, wherever they entertain
there, you gain favor with one class of the community
whose assistance is of great importance to travelers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Bonneville ventured to tell him that there
were difficulties in the way of posting, as we were
not furnished with those papers which were sometimes
inquired for at post-houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I will manage that very soon for you,” said
our host. “The mayor shall furnish you with the
necessary passports.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he knows nothing of us,” replied Father
Bonneville.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knows me,” replied the other, with a significant
nod of his head, “he wont refuse me. It is
rather a painful state of things when each man’s life
is in another man’s power. There are plenty to
misuse the advantage, and I have never seen why I
should not employ it to better purposes. The mayor
will probably be guillotined in six months. He calculates
it will be longer, but I think he makes a
mistake. However, he knows I could have him
guillotined in six days, and is therefore very compliable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And pray,” said Father Bonneville, with a
somewhat rueful smile, “how long do you contemplate
keeping your own head where it is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is hardly worth consideration,” replied the
other; “for I say of my head, as a friend of mine
said of his house which was likely to fall about his
ears, ‘It will last my time.’ In truth it is of very
little use to any but myself, or I dare say they would
have taken it long ago. The same worthlessness
may or may not protect it for a month, a year, or
even till these evil times pass away; for you are not
to suppose, my good friend, that this state will last
for ever. It is a mere irruption of human vanity.
We Frenchmen are the vainest people upon earth,
the whole nation is vain, and every individual is
vain. This vanity makes each man unwilling to see
any other a bit higher, richer, or in any respect better
off than himself; but there are certain fundamental
laws of order which man may overturn for a time,
but which always resume their power. The wise
rule in the end. Industry and talent raise themselves
in spite of resistance, forethought and care
produce wealth, and if you were to take every acre
of land throughout France, and every louis d’or,
and divide them equally amongst the whole people,
so that there should not be the difference of a sous,
before fifty years had passed you would find the differences
all restored, some men rich, other men poor,
some men ruling, other men obeying, some enjoying,
others laboring. Nay more, my belief is, that
within the same time, you would find rank, titles
and distinctions restored also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Bonneville shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very sure of it,” replied the other, in answer
to the doubtful shake. “There are many
countries in which a pure democracy might exist—perhaps
in England—but certainly not in France.
Our very blood is feudal and chivalrous. History,
which is the memory of nations, is filled with nothing
but feudal and chivalrous facts. We are too
light, too vain, too volatile to do without distinction
for any length of time, and we have not a sufficient
spirit of organization in our character to do without
a king in some shape or other. I think it must be
an absolute shape; but take my word for it, France
will never be forty years at any one time without
counts, barons and marquises, dukes, peers, stars and
ribbons. You might as well attempt to make us
Quakers as real republicans. A lion may perhaps
be taught to dance like a monkey for an hour or
two, but take my word for it, in the end he will eat
his dancing-master; and you might as well attempt
to change a lion’s nature as a Frenchman’s. However,
you shall have the passports to-morrow, or I do
not know the mayor. He is a very excellent person,
but has an over-strong regard for the integrity
of his neck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I possessed your secret of living so much
at ease amidst such scenes, and exercising so much
influence over such men,” said Father Bonneville.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mystery, mystery!” said our host with a smile.
“That is the whole secret. No one knows what I
am going to do next. No one knows why I am
going to do it. Whenever there is any great question
agitated in regard to which I am forced to take
a part, I give a full and complete explanation of my
views, in terms which not a man who hears me can
comprehend. I use the language of the times, the
cant words and pet phrases of the multitude, and
generally I go one little step before any of the movements
I see coming; for where millions of people
are running a race, as we are in France, the man
who stops even to buckle his shoe is certain to be
knocked down and trampled to death. But now I
will show you your sleeping place. You will find
the beds good. May you never have worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our host was as good as his word in all respects.
Before we woke in the morning the passports had
been procured, containing a very tolerable description
of Father Bonneville under the name of Citoyen
Jerome Charlier, and of myself under that of Louis
Lassi. Our horses were sold to no great disadvantage
by the intervention of our entertainer, a little
post-chaise bought from the post-master himself, at
about five louis more than it was worth, and at
about eleven o’clock in the day we set out on the
direct road for Paris, in a manner which suited me
much better, I confess, than that which we had previously
pursued. I have little doubt that the good
Father, too, who had not ridden for twenty years,
was in the same predicament. I will only dwell
upon our farther journey toward the capital so far
as to state that it passed easily, and without interruption,
which we attributed to the fact of having
cut across the country, in such a direction as to be
now traveling upon a line of high road totally different
from that which led from Paris to the place of
our previous residence.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE CAPITAL.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>My remembrance of the journey to Paris, and the
conversations which took place upon the road, is
more perfect than of any other of the events which
took place at that time. But it is, perhaps, in some
degree a factitious memory; for I have talked about
it so frequently since, that I hardly know which are
the facts supplied by my own mind, which those
related to me by others. I recollect clearly and distinctly,
however, our entrance into Paris on a dark
and stormy night, our detention at the gates, and the
examination of the carriage by lantern-light. I shall
not, I think, ever forget the impression produced
upon my mind by the long, tortuous streets of that
great capital, with the dim lanterns swinging on
chains stretched across from house to house, the
enormously tall buildings on every side, and the
multitude of people who thronged the streets even
at that hour, and in that weather. I thought the journey
through Paris would never have come to an end,
but at length the <span class='it'>chaise de poste</span> drove into the court
of a second-rate inn, in the Rue des Victoires, not
far from the hospital of the Quinze-vingts. Our
arrival created no sensation. No active porters, no
ready waiters were there to welcome or assist.
The house rose dark and gloomy, on the four sides
of the court-yard, up to an amazing height in the
sky, leaving us, like Truth, in the bottom of a well,
and as good Father Bonneville knew not much more
of the ways of Paris than I did myself, I do not
know what would have become of us if it had not
been necessary to pay the postillion. It was too
dark in the court to see the money, and as he did
not choose to take it upon trust, he said he would
go and fetch the concierge and his lantern. Accordingly,
he dug out of a den, at the side of the port-cochere,
a very curious, antiquated specimen of
humanity, with a broad belt over his shoulder, very
much like one of those in which the beadles of old
French churches used to stick their useless swords.
He held the lantern while the money was counted
out, and then was kind enough, though somewhat
slowly, to lead us up a very dark and narrow stair-case
to the first floor of the house, where the hotel
in reality began. I never discovered what was done
with the ground floor; for there were no shops in it,
and it seemed to be left entirely to take care of itself.
The mistress of the house—she had a husband,
but poor little thing, he never presumed to interfere
in any thing—was an enormously tall, and tolerably
portly woman, apparently of five or six and thirty
years of age, very fresh, good-looking and good-humored.
She was a Fleming by birth, and bore evident
traces of her origin in her fair hair, blue eyes,
and brilliant complexion. She was enchanted to
see us, she assured us, would provide for our accommodation
as no other people had ever been provided
for before, ordered some supper for us immediately,
and in the meanwhile, took us to see our rooms,
which were a story higher. There was a great,
large, gloomy chamber, tesselated with brick well
waxed, a bed in an alcove, two small closets on
each side of the alcove, and a fire-place big enough
to burn a forest. This was for Father Bonneville.
My own room was about the size of the alcove and
its two closets, and close by the side of the good
Father’s chamber. To my young eyes it looked
more snug and comfortable than his. But we were
each contented it would seem. The bags were
brought up, the post-chaise put in the remise, and
my little store of clothing being placed in my room,
I washed away the dust of travel, brushed the
young, unfrosted hair which then curled so thickly
over my head, and feeling somewhat solitary in the
great world around me, found my way to the chamber
of my good preceptor, who was sitting with his
feet, one upon each andiron, contemplating with
deep interest, as it seemed to me, the blazing logs
as they fizzed and crackled on the hearth. Poor
man, his thoughts, I fancy, were very far away, and
he took no notice of me for a minute or two, while I
meditated on the intense smell of roasting coffee and
veal ragout which seemed to form the atmosphere
of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Bonneville had just wakened from his reverie,
and was speaking a word or two as the commencement
of a conversation, when a waiter came
in to announce that our supper was ready, with as
discreet and deferential an air as if we had been two
aristocrats living under the ancien regime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go down with him, Louis,” said Father Bonneville,
“and I will join you directly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I followed the waiter down the stairs which I was
now happy to find lighted by a single lamp, and entered
the <span class='it'>salle à manger</span>. How can I describe the
dinginess of that strange room? It was long and
not very large, with a good-sized table down the
middle, and a fire-place with a broad mantlepiece in
one corner. Three windows, which were supposed
to give it light in the day time, but which, as they
looked into the narrow court, never caught one
genuine, unadulterated ray of the sun, now looked
as black as ink upon the wall, although, sooth to say,
that wall itself was of a hue little less sombre. Who
was the inventor of painting panneling in oil, I really
do not know, but I cannot imagine that any hand
but his own could have so decorated that wall, or
that a brush of any kind could ever have touched it
afterward. I believe that there were nymphs dancing,
represented on the spaces between the windows, but
they certainly looked like Hottentots dancing in the
dark. The furniture of the room was very scanty,
consisting of nothing but the long dining-table, and
chairs enough to fit it, but over the end of the table
nearest the fire-place, was spread a beautifully white
damask cloth, on which appeared two candlesticks,
two napkins, a number of knives and forks and
plates, and no less than eight dishes, from which exhaled
a very savory odor, I mechanically walked up
toward the fire, when suddenly, to my horror and
consternation, a voice addressed me from the mantlepiece,
exclaiming, “Petit coquin, petit coquin!” and
the next instant there was a whirr, and I felt something
brush my cheek and fall upon my shoulder.
On examination, it proved to be a bird of a kind
which I had never seen before, and which, in this
individual instance, I probably should not have recognized,
if I had seen a thousand of its species. It
was a cockatoo, which had thought fit to moult in
the midst of the winter, and had done it so completely,
that though warmly enough robed in a covering
of fine down, not a feather was to be seen upon
its body, except the pen feathers of the wings, those
of the tail, and a long yellow crest on the head. I
call it yellow, because that is the color it ought to
have been, but, to say sooth, its fondness for the
chimney-corner had so completely smoked my new
friend, that the general hue of its whole body was a
dull but most decided gray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed an amiable and affectionate bird, however,
although with its yellowish crest, and unfeathered
form, it looked very much like one of those
meagre dowagers whom we see at parties with
dresses a great deal too much cut down for the satisfaction
of the beholders. It continued repeating in
a playful and endearing tone, “petit coquin, petit
coquin!” as if it imagined the epithet to imply the
greatest tenderness. While the words were yet in
its beak, however, and before any regular conversation
had begun between us, the party was augmented
by another gentleman carrying in his hand a
round hat with three broad bands, which was generally
one of the signs or symbols of a man well provided
in official situations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a stout and self-important, but evidently
a very keen personage. He was one of those for
whom trifles have much importance, not from any
peculiar capacity for dealing in details, but because
a natural tendency of the mind of man to attach a
certain degree of magnitude to all he observes himself
had not been properly corrected in his youth.
The bird was still rhyming, “petit coquin, petit
coquin,” and advancing at once toward me with an
air of jovial frankness, he caught me by the arm,
saying, “Ah, little rogue, the bird knows you, it
seems. Now, you are some young aristocrat, I will
warrant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it so happened, that I made the exact answer
which was required under the circumstances.
Let it be understood that I had received no instructions
whatever; that Father Bonneville had
never even touched upon the subject of politics in
his own house; that while deploring excesses, and
excited and alarmed by the crimes, which he saw
going on every day around him, he had never even
hinted an opinion upon any of the great questions
which agitated the public mind at the time. But in
my walks through the town and the country, I had
been so much accustomed, for the last twelve months
or more, to hear the name of aristocrat applied to
any one who wore a better coat than his neighbor,
that I gradually learned to look upon that term as
implying the basest, meanest, and most pitiful of all
things. My cheek flushed, my brow contracted with
an expression of anger which could not be assumed,
and I replied, sharply, “No, citizen, no! Neither I,
or any one I know, are aristocrats. You insult us by
calling us so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My passion was ridiculous enough; for I had not
the slightest idea in the world what the word aristocrat
meant. Nevertheless, it had its effect, although
that might have been lost for want of witnesses, had
not Madame Michaud entered the room at the moment,
to see that everything was properly provided
for her honored guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, Monsieur Le Commissaire,” she said, “I
think you have got your answer. You do not expect
to find aristocrats in my house, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have found one,” answered the commissary,
nodding his head; “and he will find soon that he is
discovered. Shake hands, citizen, if you are really
and truly a lover of your country and the rights of
man. But mind, you don’t presume to touch my
hand if you are only shamming a love of freedom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I placed my hand in his boldly, and shook it
warmly; for I had as little idea of that in which
true freedom consists as most of his patient followers
in the political career, who, with very rare exceptions,
were devout worshipers of words, with a very
indefinite notion, indeed, of things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was satisfied, it seemed, and sat down to take
a cup of coffee and drink a glass of liqueur with
Madame Michaud—without paying for them. Indeed,
he seemed upon very amicable terms with the
lady, and I strongly suspect that it was good policy
in all hostesses of Paris, not to refuse any thing that
commissaries of police might think fit to demand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after, Father Bonneville made his appearance,
and although he answered all civil interrogatories,
he played his part so discreetly, that no suspicion
seemed to be aroused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commissary quitted the room in jovial good-humor,
and the rest of the evening passed without
any thing remarkable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About this time, the images which memory presents
in her long looking-glass, are somewhat vague,
and ill-defined—perhaps I have not had the opportunity
of refreshing my remembrance as to the minute
details, and many a scene stands out in strong relief
from a picture generally dark and obscure. Only
one of those scenes will I notice here, before I go on
to matters more immediately affecting myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was what is called a <span class='it'>table d’hôte</span> at the
inn where we stayed—a great accommodation to travelers—which
is now very common, though in the
time I speak of, it was more customary to lodge in
what is called an <span class='it'>hôtel garni</span>, and to obtain one’s food
from without. One day, I know not whether it was
the second or third after our arrival, we were seated
at the dinner-table in the hall, when the same commissary
of police I have mentioned, entered the
room, and slowly looked round the guests. I could
see many a changing countenance at the table—some
rosy faces which became white, and warm, glowing
lips, which partook of on ashy paleness. The commissioner,
however, fixed his eyes upon one particular
gentleman, a man, perhaps, of fifty-seven or
fifty-eight years of age, who had been one of the
lightest and gayest of the guests. He saw the peculiar
look of the officer, and probably understood its
meaning completely; but he staid to finish quietly the
joke which hung upon his lips, and then asked with
the laugh still ringing around him—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mister commissary, is your business with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commissary slowly nodded his head, and our
friend who was sitting next to Father Bonneville on
the right, instantly rose, saying with a jocund smile—“I
anticipated great things from the second course,
but I must resign it, and do so with the self denial of
a hermit. Ladies and gentlemen, there are three
things greatly to be desired in life: a pleasant hopeful
youth; a warm and genial middle life; and a short,
unclouded, old age. The two first I have obtained, by
the mercy of God—or of the Gods—or of any God that
you like, Monsieur Commissaire—the third is very
likely to be granted to me likewise. I will therefore
only drink one more glass to the good health of all
here present, before I drink another draught little less
acceptable, and infinitely more tranquilizing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus saying, he raised a glass of wine already filled,
toward his lips, bowed gracefully round the table,
drank the wine, and walked out of the room with
the commissary of police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day, at noon, we heard he had just been
guillotined.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>OLD ACQUAINTANCES RENEWED.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Why we lingered in Paris I never knew, or have
forgotten. It is very probable, there were difficulties
in the way to the frontier, which good Father Bonneville
feared to encounter—or, perhaps, he was sensible
of the approach of severe illness, and feared to
undertake the journey in such a state of health.
The fatigues of our flight had been too much for the
old man, and although he never appeared upon the
way half as tired as I was, yet, after our labors were
over, while I rallied and became as brisk and active
as ever in four-and-twenty hours, he remained languid
and feeble, and unwilling to stir out of his room.
He would not confine me, however, to the hotel,
but suffered me to visit various parts of Paris, where
objects worthy of attention were to be seen. I thus
acquired a tolerable knowledge of the principal leading
thoroughfares of the town, and could find my
way from one part of the city to another, with perfect
ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time, I shut my eyes to the fact that my
old friend and protector was really ill; but when we
had been in Paris about a fortnight, the change which
had taken place in his appearance, his pale and haggard
face, and the thinness of his always delicate
and beautiful hands, awoke me to a sense of his real
state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear you are not well, my Father,” I said, as I
sat by his side, while he leaned back in his great
chair, with his feet to the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Bonneville shook his head mournfully, and
I urged him to let me go for a physician.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you must, Louis,” he answered; “for
I do feel very ill, and I would fain recover strength
enough at all events, to place you, my son, in safety
before I die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a physician lives close by,” I said, “I
can run for him in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” cried the good priest, “that will not
do. There was a physician here in Paris, whom I
knew in days of old—a good and a sincere man, who
would not betray us, but on the contrary, would give
us aid and advice in other matters, besides those of
mere health. Do you know the Place Du Petit
Chatelet, Louis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I replied, that I knew it well, and Father Bonneville
wrote down the name of a physician, and the
number of his house, saying in the desponding tone
of sickness—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely he may be dead, and then I know not
what we shall do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without any loss of time, I sallied out into the
streets of Paris, in search of Dr. L——. It was a
fine, clear, cold afternoon, with the snow lying piled
up at the sides of the streets, the fountains all frozen,
and the chains of the street-lamps covered with glittering
frost. The wind was keen and cutting, and
few people, especially of the lower orders, were in
the street; for though <span class='it'>sans culottism</span> may be a very
good thing, it is by no means warm, and the worthy
rulers of the destinies of France at that moment, had
not great-coats enough amongst them to render them
indifferent to a north-east wind. I could thus pursue
my way rapidly, uninterrupted by the crowds which
usually thronged the streets of the French capital,
and though doubtless I did not take all the shortest
ways, I soon reached the place I was seeking. The
houses were tall, dirty, well-smoked, and ever open
doors round the whole place, gave entrance to innumerable
stair-cases which led up to the dwellings of
low advocates, notaries public, physicians, artists,
poor men of letters, and all that class who scrape a
precarious existence from the faults, the follies, the
misfortunes, the miseries of others. But now I had
a very puzzling calculation to make. Father Bonneville
had written down, after the name of Dr.
L——, number five, Place du Petit Chatelet, but not
a house was to be seen which had a number on it,
and I was obliged to guess at which corner the numeration
commenced. I was evidently wrong in my
first essay, for no Doctor L—— could I find in the
house which I fixed upon; and short and snappish
were the answers I got at the various doors where
I applied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That could not be number five, and so I turned to
the other side of the square, and began in the opposite
direction. As I was counting the houses from
the corner, I saw a little girl coming from a street
nearly in face of me, with a basket in her hand, and
poorly dressed. She turned suddenly into one of the
door-ways, and I sprang after her, running as fast as
possible and nearly overturning an old woman, who
was roasting chestnuts in a tin kettle—for which I
had my benediction. Little cared I, however; for
my heart beat wildly, and the only thing I feared at
that moment, was, that I should lose sight of that
little girl with the basket; for I had taken it into my
head at once that she was Mariette de Salins. She
had gone up the stairs, however, when I reached the
door, and without pausing for an instant I ran up
after her, just in time to see her enter an apartment
on the second floor, the door of which was closing as
I approached. I knocked sharply, without a moment’s
consideration, when an elderly man, with thin
and powdered white hair, and a pleasant, though
grave expression of countenance, presented himself,
asking who I wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment’s consideration had shown me that it
might be dangerous to mention the name of Mariette;
nor must it be supposed that such discretion
was at all marvelous in a boy of my age at that
time; for those were days of constant peril, when
every act was to be thought of, every word weighed,
and the habit of caution and reserve was inculcated
as a duty upon even mere children. On the spur of
the occasion, then, I replied that I was seeking Dr.
L——, still keeping my eyes fixed upon a door which
stood ajar heading into a room beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Doctor L——,” replied the old man.
“What is it you want with me, my son? And why
are you looking so earnestly in there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to come and see a gentleman who
is sick,” I replied, “in the Hotel de Clermont, close
by the Quinze-vingts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he very ill?” asked the doctor. “What is
his name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before I could answer either of his questions
the inner door I have mentioned was drawn back,
the beautiful little face peeped out, and in a moment
after Mariette was in my arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought it was you, dear Mariette,” I cried,
kissing her tenderly, while she seemed never tired
of hugging me. “Where is your mother? How is
she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, hush!” said the old doctor, closing the
outer door; “no questions or answers of any kind
here, except medical ones. Mariette knows well
that she must be silent, and answer no inquiries—and
so,” he continued, after having thus stopped all
explanations between us, “I suppose I am to conclude,
my son, that this story of the sick man is a
fiction, and that your object was to catch your little
playfellow here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No indeed,” I replied, with some indignation,
“I have not been taught to speak falsehoods, sir.
The gentleman I mentioned, does wish to see you,
and is very ill. His name you will know when you
see him; for you have met before—not that I mean
to say I did not want to see Mariette, and indeed
you must let her tell me where I can find her; for
it is a long, long time since I have seen her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That cannot be,” said the doctor, gravely; “she
must learn to keep counsel—are you of the same
town, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she lived with me for a long time,” I replied;
“and the gentleman whom I want you to
come and see is the same who was so kind to her
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to see him very much,” said Mariette,
looking down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, I will go to him,” said the doctor,
gravely, “and if it be proper that you two children
should meet again, I will bring it about. Now you,
Mariette, go in and empty your basket as usual.
You, my son, go back to your friend, and say I will
be with him in an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus saying, he led me gently by the arm to the
door and put me out, and I hastened back with all
my intelligence to Father Bonneville, asking him if
it were not strange that I should find Mariette just
at the house of Doctor L——.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not,” replied the good priest, with a
faint smile. “The doctor is a native of our own
province, and known to many of the good and the
wise there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said no more upon the subject, and made no
inquiries, but remained somewhat listlessly in his
chair gazing into the fire, till at length came a gentle
knock at the door, and the physician entered, dressed
with somewhat more care than he had been an hour
before, with a three-cornered hat on his head, and a
gold-headed cane in his hand. He approached Father
Bonneville with an unconscious air, and without
the slightest sign of recognition, till the old priest
held out his hand to him, saying—“Ah, my friend,
do you not remember me? You have not changed
so much as I have, it would seem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doctor L—— started back; for the sweet, silvery
tones of the voice seemed to wake up memory, and
he exclaimed—“Is it possible? my good friend,
Bonneville!—Nay, nay. You are too much changed
for time to have done it all. You must be really ill.
Leave us, my young friend, I doubt not we shall
soon set all this to rights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I retreated into my little room where it was cold
enough, for there was no fire-place, and waited there
shivering very tolerably for nearly an hour, while
Dr. L—— and the good priest remained in consultation.
At the end of that time Dr. L—— came and
called me back, and when I re-entered Father Bonneville’s
room, held me by the arm at a little distance
from him, gazing very earnestly in my face,
and seeming to scrutinize every line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said at length, turning to my old friend;
“yes, he is very like him—Poor boy, what a fate!—Well,
my young friend,” he said, suddenly changing
the subject. “We must get good Citizen Charlier
here, to his bed as soon as possible. He will be well
soon, and would have been well by this time if he
had sent for me before. But we must try and make
up for lost time. I will not send him to the apothecary’s,”
he said, “for drugs, for we are never sure
of them at those places—one man acknowledged the
other day that during twenty years he had never sold
one genuine ounce of rhubarb. I have two other
visits to pay; but let him come to my house in an
hour and a half, and I will send what will do you
good. Perhaps I may see you again to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I find Mariette with you?” I asked, looking
up in the doctor’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good man shook his head, and then turning to
Father Bonneville, said with a smile—“I think these
two children are in love with each other; but little
Mariette is so discreet that she would not even tell
me who he was or who you were. She has had
bitter lessons of caution for one so young—perhaps
you may sometimes see her at my house, my son;
but you must imitate her discretion, and neither ask
any questions, nor answer them if put to you by
strangers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Louis is growing very discreet,” said Father
Bonneville; “for we have had warnings enough
since we have been in this house to prevent us from
taking the bridle off our tongues for a moment—fare
you well, my good friend, I shall be glad to
see you again to-night if you can contrive to come;
but yet I do not think it is needful for my health that
you should take such trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will see, we will see,” replied the doctor,
and shaking him by the hand he left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good Father, then, with my assistance, undressed
and went to bed, where, to say sooth, he
would have been much better three or four days before;
and at the appointed hour I went for the medicines
which had been promised, but saw no one
except an old female servant, who gave me two bottles
addressed to Citizen Charlier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I returned, I met a furious mob coming up the
streets with a bloody head upon a pike, and perhaps
I was in some peril, though I was not aware of it at
the time. My dress, though very plain, was neat
and whole, and I was seized as I attempted to pass
through the mob, by a gaunt, fierce-looking man,
with hardly one untattered piece of clothing on his
back. He called me a cursed little aristocrat, and
made the man who bore the head upon the pike,
lower the bloody witness of their inhuman deeds to
make me kiss it. They brought it to the level of
my head, and thrust its dark, contorted features into
my face. But I stoutly refused to kiss it, saying I
was not an aristocrat; and why should I kiss a head
that they told me had belonged to one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you can make me out an aristocrat,” I exclaimed,
“I will kiss it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you got here in your hand?” cried
the sans-culotte, snatching the bottles from me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only medicines for a sick man,” I replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tore off the paper, however, opened one of the
bottles and put it to his mouth, then spat upon the
ground with a blasphemous oath, exclaiming—“He
is only a garçon apothecaire. Let him pass, let him
pass! He will kill as many sacre aristocrats with
his cursed drugs as we can with the guillotine.
Let the imp pass. His is a trade that should be encouraged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus saying, he marched on, and his fierce and
malignant companions followed. I cannot say that
I was in reality at all frightened. Every thing had
passed so quickly that I had not had time to become
alarmed; but I felt bewildered, and paused for a moment
to gather my senses together after the mob had
passed into the Place du Petit Chatelet which was
close at hand. I was still standing there when I
heard a voice saying, “Louis, Louis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked round, but could see nobody, and the only
place from which the sound could proceed, appeared
to be one of those open doors so common in Paris at
the time, with a dark passage beyond it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Louis, Louis,” said the voice again; “come in
here, I want to speak to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not the tongue of Mariette certainly; for
her sweet, child-like tones I should have known any
where; and I hesitated whether I should go in or
not. I resolved not to seem cowardly, however,
and walked into the passage. I could then see
faintly, a tall, and as it appeared to me, graceful
figure move on before me, and I followed into a little
room quite at the back of the house, to which the
light was admitted from a little court behind.
There the figure turned as I entered, and I beheld
Madame de Salins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room itself presented a painful picture of
poverty. It could not have been above ten feet
square, and in one corner, without curtains, or any
shelter from the wind, was the bed of Madame de
Salins herself, and close by it a little bed for her
daughter. The latter, indeed, was fenced round
with a shawl hung upon two chairs, which only left
one in the room vacant. A table, a broken looking-glass,
a few cups and glasses, with a coffee-pot
standing by the fire, seemed to form all the other
furniture of the chamber. I had very little time to
look round me; for Madame de Salins at once began
to inquire after the health of Father Bonneville.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw you from a front window,” she said, as
soon as I had answered her first questions, “and
feared that those men would maltreat you; for they
have the hearts of tigers, and spare no one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden fear seized me, lest Mariette should be
even then coming from the house of good Doctor
L——, and encounter the ruffians whom I had just
escaped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Mariette at the Place du Chatelet?” I asked,
eagerly. “Let me go and see that no harm happens
to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” replied Madame de Salins. “She is
here with the old lady in the front room, who lets us
sometimes sit with her, as a relief from this dark, dismal
hole. You are a good, brave boy, however, Louis,
and for every kind and generous act you do, depend
upon it you will have your reward. Mariette, thank
God, is quite safe, and she has learnt whenever she
sees a crowd to avoid it. But tell me more about
Father Bonneville. Does Doctor L—— think he is
in danger?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was not able to give her any satisfactory answer,
for I really did not know what was the physician’s
opinion of my good preceptor’s case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him,” said Madame de Salins, “that I will
come to see him if I can do so secretly; but I am
under surveillance, and all my movements, I fear,
will be watched till some new change takes place in
this ever-shifting government. I have several things
to say to him, and could wish to see him much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke in an anxious and thoughtful tone, and
doubtless had many matters of deep and painful importance
pressing upon her mind at the moment.
Boy-like, however, my attention was directed principally
to the more obvious inconveniencies which
she suffered, and I said, “I am afraid you must be
very badly off here, madame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady smiled. “Badly enough, my dear boy,”
she replied. “But yet we might be very much
worse—nay, we have been much worse in mind, if
not in body. But I will not keep you now. Tell
Monsieur de Bonneville what I have said, and add
that if he has any thing to reply, he can communicate
it to me through Doctor L——.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I reached the inn, my first task was to give
good Father Bonneville the medicine prescribed for
him, and then to tell him of my interview with
Madame de Salins. He seemed greatly interested,
and repeated once or twice, “Poor thing! poor
thing! I hope she will be successful; but I can’t
help her—I can do nothing to help her. I know too
little to give her advice, and have no power to give
her assistance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not press the subject upon him, nor make any
inquiries, but sat for a long time by his bed-side
reading to him both in Latin and in French. English
was by this time quite forbidden between us, and
we had no English books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the evening, toward nine o’clock, Doctor L——
came again, and felt his patient’s pulse with a cheerful
air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The good woman of the house,” he said, “waylaid
me on the stairs, to ask if you were likely to
die, my good friend, and to suggest that in that case
it would be as well to send you to the hospital. I
have spared you that journey, however, by assuring
her that in a week or ten days you will be well
enough to go to the opera, if by that time they have
left any singers with their heads on. They guillotined
poor Benoit this morning. I ventured to suggest
that they would not get such another tenor in a
hurry; and so they made him sing before they put
him into the cart, to try, I suppose, how they liked
it. Whether he sang too well or too ill to please
them, I don’t know, but they drove him off to the
guillotine, while I was seeing another prisoner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Bonneville gave a shudder; but sickness is
always more or less selfish, and though naturally one
of the most unselfish men in the world, his thoughts
speedily reverted to himself. “I trust,” he said,
“that there will be no necessity for sending me to the
hospital. Did you quite satisfy the good woman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite,” replied Doctor L——. “I told her that
I would be answerable for your not giving occasion
to a funeral from her house, which is what all these
good aubergiste fear. I told her, moreover, that
when your daughter and your granddaughter arrived
from the country, you would very speedily rally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughter,” said Father Bonneville, with a
faint smile. “I have no daughter but spiritual
daughters, my friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps we may find you one for the occasion,”
said Doctor L——, laughing. “But I will tell you
more about it to-morrow; for although you must be,
of course, consulted whether you will have a child
or not, yet in this case, out of the ordinary course of
nature, the child must first be asked whether she
likes to be born. In short, I have a scheme in my
head, my good friend; but it requires maturing, and
the pivot upon which it all turns is your rapid recovery.
So take care of yourself; cast care from
your mind for the present, and you will speedily
be both well and strong again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus saying, he left him, and for two or three days
no event of any importance occurred, except the
gradual improvement of Father Bonneville, under
the kind and zealous treatment of the good physician.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A PERIOD OF CHANGES.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At the period I speak of there were changes in
Paris every day. True, one horror was only succeeded
by another, and one fierce tyranny but made
place for a tyranny more fierce and barbarous. The
condemnation of the king, and his death, which followed
shortly after, occupied for a time all thoughts,
and filled many a bosom which had previously felt
the strongest, nay, even the wildest aspirations for
liberty, with gloom, and doubt, and dread. The moment,
however, the head of the good king fell upon
the scaffold the death-struggle began between the
Mountain and the Gironde, and in the many heaves
and throes of the contending factions, many persons
found opportunity to escape from perils which had
previously surrounded them. Although a mere boy
at the time, I was quite familiar with the daily history
of these events; for they were in every body’s
mouth, and I might even greatly swell this little
memoir, by narrating minutely the various scenes,
some terrible, some ludicrous, which I myself beheld.
The most terrible was the death of the king,
of which, jammed in by the multitude, without a
possibility of escape, I was myself present, and
within a few yards of the instrument of death. But
it is my object to pass as lightly as possible over
these young recollections, though many of them were
too deeply graven on memory ever to be effaced. I
shall never forget, as long as I live, the face of a tall,
gaunt man, who was close to me at the moment
when the king attempted to speak to the people,
and the drums were ordered to beat, to drown
the voice of the royal martyr. Rage and indignation
and shame were written in every line, and I heard
him mutter between his teeth, “Oh, were there but
an hundred men in Paris true to France and to
themselves!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My own belief is, that a very few acting at that
moment in concert, and fearless of their own safety,
might not only have saved the effusion of the king’s
blood, but might have given a different direction to
the revolution, and saved the lives of thousands.
However that might be, I went away from the scene
with horror, and shut myself up for the rest of the
day with good Father Bonneville, who was now
able to rise. The physician saw him twice during
the day, and once I was sent out of the room for a
short time. Doctor L—— spoke jokingly more than
once in my presence, of the good priest’s daughter
and granddaughter, and though I did not see the
point of the jest, I imagined it was one way he had
of amusing himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Bonneville, however, seemed to me to
humor him strangely, answering him in the same
strain, and inquiring when he thought his daughter
would arrive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really cannot tell,” replied the physician. “But,
of course, you will have a letter from her before she
comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three days afterward a letter was brought from
the post-office, and Father Bonneville examined the
seal with a smile. It had not been considered inviolable,
that was clear; for either at the post-office
or in the hotel, they had thought fit to open the letter
without even taking the decent precaution of resealing
it again. The contents of the epistle I saw,
and they certainly puzzled me a good deal when first
Father Bonneville gave the paper into my hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letter began, “My dear Father,” and went
on in the usual strain of a child writing to a parent,
telling him how much grieved she was to hear that
he had been sick in Paris, expressing fears that he
had over-fatigued himself in seeking for news of her
dear husband, and informing him that she would soon
be in Paris herself, with her little girl, to pursue the
inquiry. The letter throughout was filled with a
great number of the cant expressions of republicanism,
then common, and it ended with declaring
that if the writer’s dear husband was dead, she could
console herself with the thought that he had died in
defense of his country, though she could not bear the
idea that he might be lingering ill of his wounds
without any affectionate hands to tend him. The
letter was addressed to “Citizen Jerome Charlier,”
was dated from a provincial town in Poitou, and
was signed “Clarisse Bonfin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Bonneville smiled as he marked the expression
of my face in reading the letter; and when
I had done, he asked me if I knew who these relations
of his were. I replied in the negative, and he
answered, nodding his head, “Some whom you know
very well; but you must remember, Louis, you are
only to know them as my daughter and granddaughter,
and as your own aunt and cousin. Call
the lady ‘Aunt Clarisse,’ or ‘Aunt Bonfin,’ and the
little girl, ‘Mariette Bonfin.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last words threw a ray of light upon the
whole affair—and I was delighted. There is nothing,
I believe, that children love so much as a
little mystery, especially boys of thirteen or fourteen;
but I had the additional satisfaction of having to play
a part in the drama—a task always charming to a
child brought up in France. I acted my character
rather well, I flatter myself; and when Father
Bonneville, well knowing that the letter had been
read before it reached him, sent me to talk to our
good hostess about rooms for our expected relations,
I gave the buxom dame quite enough of Aunt Bonfin
and Cousin Mariette, and described them both so accurately,
that she could have no doubt of my personal
acquaintance with these supposed connections.
She thought it best, however, to deal with Citizen
Charlier himself in regard to the apartments to be
engaged, and visited him in his room for that purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old gentleman was very taciturn, and seemed
to think it a part of his character to drive a hard bargain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His daughter,” he said, “was not rich: she had
a great deal of hard-work and traveling before her to
find out what had become of her husband, who had
been wounded if not killed at Jenappes, and she
could not afford to throw her money away in inns.”
There was a good deal of skirmishing on these
points, and a good deal of laughter and jest upon the
part of our hostess, who seemed as well contented,
and as comfortable as if there were no such thing as
a guillotine in the world, though her table d’hôte
rather suffered from time to time, in consequence of
her guests being deprived of the organs of mastication
amongst others. The whole, however, was
settled at length, and two days afterward, I was informed
that Madame Bonfin had arrived with her
daughter in a little post-chaise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good priest was not yet well enough to quit
his room, but I ran down the dingy stair-case into
the court-yard, and as I expected, found Madame de
Salins and Mariette just getting out of a dirty little
vehicle, with a wooden apron, which bore the name
of a cabriolet. Madame de Salins embraced me
kindly, and I did not forget to call her Aunt Clarisse,
while Mariette literally sprang into my arms, and I
thought would have smothered me with caresses.
If there had been any doubts previously in the minds
of the people of the inn, they were all dissipated by
the tenderness of this meeting, and Madame de Salins
and her daughter followed me up stairs to the
room of good Father Bonneville. One of the waiters
accompanied us, but there the meeting was conducted
as naturally as it had been below, and the
words, “my daughter” and “my father,” passed habitually
between the good priest and the high-born
lady without any pause or hesitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her own apartments were next shown to Madame
de Salins, and her baggage was brought up from below,
when I remarked that every thing had been
carefully marked with the initials C. B., to signify
Clarisse Bonfin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh what actors every body in Paris became at that
period! Some were so by nature; for very nearly
one half of the world is always acting a part. Others
did it because it was the tone of the day; and these
formed the heroic or tragic band, who did every thing
with Roman dignity and firmness, and carried the
farce of representation into the very last act of the
tragedy. Others were driven to act parts which did
not belong to them, by the perils or necessities of
their situation; and amongst these, was Madame de
Salins, who, dressed somewhat in the <span class='it'>mode paysanne</span>,
was out frequently, went boldly to police offices,
and to military authorities, inquiring diligently
after her husband, John Bonfin, and demanded intelligence
regarding the state and condition of a man
who had never existed. A change in the direction
of civic affairs, and the decapitation of two or three
gentlemen, who had watched her diligently while in
her lodging near the Place du Petit Chatelet, had
now set her comparatively free, and she used her
powers of persuasion, and her liberty, so well, that
she obtained letters of recommendation to the medical
officers of the armies of Dumouriez and Kellerman,
with a satisfactory pass for herself, and her father,
with two children. Upon what pretence she
made her traveling party so large, I do not know;
but she certainly carried her point. She was out
more than once at night, too, and I remarked that
Mariette was now sent daily to the house of Doctor
L——, to bring the bottles of medicine which were
still required by Father Bonneville—a task, which I
always previously fulfilled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the distance was considerable, and the way
somewhat intricate, I was permitted to accompany
and guide my little companion, as far as the street
leading into the Place du Chatelet, but was directed
to go no farther, and wait there for her return. I
had learned by this time to ask no questions, but I
could not help thinking that Mariette often stayed a
long time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not know that I was of a very observing disposition,
or inclined to be particularly censorious,
but one thing I remarked which surprised me a good
deal, and I recollect, quite well, that it gave me uncomfortable
feelings. In my first interview with Madame
de Salins, she had appeared overwhelmed with
grief and terror, her clothes stained with her husband’s
blood, and a look of wild, almost frantic horror
in her face, which was never to be forgotten.
Now, however, she had not only completely recovered
her composure, but was generally cheerful,
and sometimes even gay. Clouds of anxiety, indeed,
would occasionally float over her beautiful brow,
and she would fall into deep fits of thought; but it
often seemed to me very strange that she should have
so soon and so completely forgotten the husband, for
whom she had seemed to mourn so sincerely. Indeed,
there is nothing which so shocks—I might
say, so terrifies, the earnest heart of youth, as to perceive
how transient are those feelings of which to
them life is made up, in the bosoms of persons older,
of more experience, and more world-hardened than
themselves. I loved Mariette, however, and Mariette
loved me, and that was a feeling which I then
fondly fancied could never decay or alter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, one day, Father Bonneville declared
himself strong enough to go out, and as there was a
slight lull at the time in the political storm, we went
to see—that is he and I—some places of public interest.
I recollect an elderly gentleman coming up
and joining in conversation with us, in a very mild
and placable tone. The good Father was very much
upon his guard, however, and in answer to some
questions, said he had been very ill since he had
come to Paris, and had enjoyed no opportunity of
seeing the sights of the capital till the time of his stay
was nearly expired. Whether the old gentleman
considered us as very stupid or not I do not know,
but he soon left us, and we found afterward that he
was one of those worthy public denunciators, who at
that time brought so many heads under the axe of the
guillotine. He lived to a good old age, and I saw
him afterward in London, playing at cards with
great devotion, and furnished with a handsome diamond
snuff-box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This little incident, which I have only mentioned
as characteristic of the times, had no result that I
know of upon our fate. Three days afterward, the
two post-chaises were got in order, horses were
brought from the post-house, and to my infinite satisfaction
we all rolled away together out of that grim
city of Paris, which will ever remain associated in
my mind with memories of blood and crime. It was
a fine day—one of those days in February which
come as if to bid us prepare for summer, long ere
summer is near, and which I think are more beautiful
and striking in France, than in any other country
I know. The sunshine lay softly upon the face of
the country, and on the top of a tall, bare tree, near
the post-house, where we first stopped to change
horses, a thrush was pouring forth its evening song,
and making the air thrill with melody. I got out of
our own little post-chaise to call Mariette’s attention
to the bird, but when I looked into their cabriolet, to
my surprise I saw that Madame de Salins was weeping
bitterly. The post-master approached and looked
in likewise; but she had great presence of mind, and
instantly beckoning the man up, she asked him some
questions regarding the movements of the armies,
and whether he could give her any news of Citizen
Bonfin, who commanded a company in Davoust’s
volunteers. The man, who seemed to compassionate
her greatly, replied that he could not, and asked if
she had any apprehensions regarding him. She answered
that the last she had heard of her husband,
was, that he had been very severely wounded, but
that careful nursing might yet save his life. The
good post-master was not a Parisian, nor a litterateur,
and so without affecting atheism, he prayed God to
bless her endeavors, and we rolled on upon our
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went on for two or three hours after dark, and
lodged as we found it expedient, at a post-house some
little distance from Clermont. There, however,
our landlord, the post-master, proposed a change in
our arrangements, which was a very agreeable one to
me. He laughed at four persons of one family traveling
in two post-chaises, assured us that it would
be much more convenient for us to go in a larger vehicle,
having one to dispose of which would exactly
suit us, and that we should save a good deal of money
by the number of post-horses. His arguments seemed
quite conclusive both to Father Bonneville and Madame
de Salins, although he demanded two hundred
livres, and our two carriages, for the one he intended
to supply, which was not worth two hundred livres
in itself. I was surprised at their acquiescence; for
I did not believe they had much money to spare; but
I rather imagine that they were afraid to oppose any
thing he thought fit to suggest, and that if he had
known their exact situation, he might have taxed
them still more largely. By one contrivance or another,
however, the papers of the family had been put
into such good order, that no suspicion seems to have
been excited any where. Perhaps, indeed, we were
too insignificant to attract much attention, and at the
end of a four days’ journey, we found ourselves rapidly
approaching the frontiers of France, somewhat
to the right of our then victorious army. This was,
perhaps, the most dangerous point of our whole expedition,
and at a spot where two hours more would
have placed us in security beyond the limits of
France, we paused for the night, in order to consider
carefully the next step, lest we should lose the fruit
of all our exertions at the very moment that it seemed
within our grasp.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A BOY’S MANŒUVRE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was decided to drive right toward the frontier,
beyond which the advance of the French army has
already been considerable. All the country, almost
to the banks of the Rhine was virtually in the hands
of France; but no general system of administration
had been thought of. The people were foreign, monarchical
and anti-Gallican, and were ready enough
to give every assistance to fugitives from a system
which they hated and condemned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This decision was taken, like all desperate ones,
upon the calculation, right or wrong, of the chances.
I was in the room when all points were discussed
between Father Bonneville and Madame de Salins.
Mariette lay sleeping in a corner of her mother’s
bed, looking like a cherub; but I, more anxious perhaps,
and more alive to the real perils of our situation
than any one of my age could have been, not
disciplined by the scenes which I had gone through
during the last two months, was still up, and listening
eagerly for every word. The order was given
for the post-horses to be put to, the next morning,
and as was necessary, the route was stated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The post-master showed some little hesitation,
saying that the road we proposed to go was directly
that to the head-quarters of the army, and that we
were none of us military people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am the wife of a soldier,” replied Madame
de Salins, at once, and with a tone of dignity, “and
these letters are for the surgeons-general of that
army, to whom I must deliver them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laid her hand upon the packet of letters which
she possessed, as she spoke, and the post-master replied
in a more deferential tone—“Very well, citoyenne,
I dare say it is all right, and I can send you
to the frontier; but whether you can get horses
beyond or not, I can’t tell. Mind, I am not responsible
beyond the frontier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning at the hour appointed the horses
were put to the carriage. They were three in number—we
had previously had four—and they were
harnessed, as was very common then in France, and
is now, abreast. The postillion, instead of getting
into his great jack-boots, as I had always previously
seen, got upon the front seat of the carriage, gathered
up the reins, and with the crack of a long whip set
out toward the frontier. He was a sullen-looking,
dull, uncommunicative person of that peculiar race
found in the neighborhood of Liege, and called Walloons;
and I, who was sitting with my shoulder
close to his, though with my back toward him, and
with nothing to intercept our communication—for
the carriage was open in front—endeavored in vain
to make him speak a word or two, addressing him
frequently but obtaining no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first I supposed that he could speak no French,
and at last gave up the undertaking. But I soon
found that he could speak French enough when it
suited his purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We drove along for about seven miles without
meeting a single human being, and seeing very few
cultivated fields; for as frontier districts generally
are, the land was left nearly untended, nobody caring
much to plant harvests that they were never sure of
reaping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We at length came to a rude stone pillar, upon as
bleak and desolate a spot as I ever remember to have
seen. The ground was elevated, but sloped gently
down to the neighboring country both before and
behind us. At least three miles of desolate marsh,
which retained its moisture, heaven knows how,
swept around us on every side, and the only object
which denoted human habitation was the outline of
a village, with some trees, seen at the distance of
some four or five miles on the plain which lay a little
below us in advance. When we reached the rude
sort of obelisk I have mentioned, the driver drew in
his reins, and the horses stopped to breathe, as I
supposed, after climbing the hill: but the next moment
the man got down from the front seat, and approaching
the side at which Father Bonneville sat,
demanded his drink-money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will give it you when we reach the next post-house,”
said Father Bonneville.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the only post-house I shall take you to,”
replied the man sullenly, but in very good French,
“I am not bound to go an inch beyond the line.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good priest remonstrated mildly, but the postillion
answered with great insolence, threatening to
take out the horses and leave us there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Bonneville answered without the slightest
heat, that he must do so if he pleased; that we were
at his mercy; but that he was bound, if possible to
take us to the next post-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing that this menace had produced no effect upon
the quiet and gentle spirit of the good old man, the
postillion now determined to try another manœuvre,
and grumbled forth that he knew very well we were
aristocrats, seeking to fly from the country, and that
therefore, like a good citizen, he should turn his
horses round, drive us back, and denounce us at the
municipality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had listened anxiously to the conversation, with
a heart beating with the fear of being stopped, and
indignation at the man’s conduct. At length a sudden
thought struck me—what suggested it I do not
know—nor how it arose, nor whether indeed thought
had any thing to do with it, though I have called it
a thought. It was more an impulse—an instinct—a
sudden determination taken without reason, which
made me clamber with the activity of a monkey
over the back of the seat on which I was sitting, and
snatch up the reins and the whip which the postillion
had laid down upon the foot-board. I was determined
to be out of France at all events, whoever staid behind;
and I cut the horses on either flank without
waiting to give notice or ask permission. I had once
or twice driven a cart, loaded with flour, from the
mill by the banks of the stream, up to Father Bonneville’s
house and back again. I had not the
slightest fear in the world; Father Bonneville cried,
“Stop, stop!” but I drove on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame de Salins gave a timid cry of surprise and
fear, but I drove on. The postillion ran shouting
and blaspheming after the carriage and tried to catch
the reins; but I gave him a tremendous cut over the
face with the whip, and drove on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know not what possessed me; but I seemed as
if I was suddenly set free—free from the oppressive
shackles of everlasting fear, and forethought and
anxiety. The frontier of France was behind me. I
was in a land where there were no guillotines—no
spies, as I thought—no denouncers—no sans-culottes
with bloody heads upon their pikes. I was free—to
act, and to think, and to speak, and to come, and to
go, as I liked. The cold, leaden, heavy spell of terror
which had hung upon me was broke the moment
I passed that frontier line, and the first use I made
of my disenchantment was to drive the horses down
that hill like a madman. Father Bonneville held
tight on by the side of the carriage. Madame de
Salins caught up Mariette, and clasped her tightly in
her arms; but still I drove on without trepidation or
pause; not that I disregarded the commands of my
good preceptor: not that I was insensible to the
alarm of Madame de Salins; but a spirit was upon me
that I could not resist. I had no fear, and therefore
I saw not why they should have any. The course
I was pursuing seemed to my young notions to offer
the only chance of safety, and therefore I thought
they ought to rejoice as well as myself; and on I
went, making the dry dust of a March day fly up
into clouds along our course, and leaving the unhappy
postillion, cursing and swearing, far, far behind
us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Happily for me, the horses were docile, and had
been long accustomed to run between the two post-houses.
If they had had a will of their own, and
that will had been contrary to mine, I am very much
afraid the majority of heads and legs would have
carried the question; but they comprehended the
object of which I aimed, and though unaccustomed
to the hand that drove them, yielded readily to its
direction—which was lucky—for about half-way
down the hill there was an enormous stone in the
middle of the road, which would have inevitably
sent us rolling down into the middle of the valley if
either of the off wheels had come in contact with it.
The third horse puzzled me a little; but it did not
matter. They had but one way to go, and we got
to the bottom of the hill without accident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop them, stop them, Louis,” cried Father
Bonneville, when all danger was in reality passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot just yet, Father,” I replied, tugging a
little at the reins, “but they will go slower in a
moment themselves;” and for nearly a mile we went
on at a full gallop. Then the good beasts fell easily
into a canter, with the exception of one, who shook
his head and tugged at the rein when I attempted to
bring him in, but soon yielded to the influence of
example, and was reduced to a trot as speedily as
the other two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When our pace was brought to a speed of about
eight miles an hour, I looked round joyously into
the carriage, saying—“We have left that rogue far
behind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Louis, Louis, you should not have done this!”
exclaimed Father Bonneville, shaking his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Madame do Salins put her hand on his arm,
saying, “He has saved us, Father. Do not—do not
check such decision and presence of mind. Remember
he is to be a man, and such qualities will be
needful to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was very proud of her praise: got the horses
easily into a quiet, ordinary pace, and drove directly
into the village which we had seen from above, and
where, as I had expected, the post-house was to be
found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horses stopped of their own accord at the
door, and we soon had two or three people round
us. Thanks to Father Bonneville’s peculiar skill
in acquiring languages, the people who seemed
good and kindly disposed, were soon made acquainted
with as much of our story as was necessary to tell.
They entered into our cause warmly; but the post-master—or
rather the post-mistress’s son—a little in
awe of the French army, some thirty or forty miles
distant, strongly advised that we should proceed
without delay, lest our French postillion should come
up, and embarrass the authorities by demanding our
apprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The advice was very palatable to us all; the
French horses were <a id='har'></a>unharnessed in a few minutes;
four fresh ones—somewhat fat and slow, indeed—were
attached to the carriage; and Father Bonneville
conscientiously deposited with the post-master
the “<span class='it'>pour boire</span>,” or drink-money, for our abandoned
postillion, with a couple of livres additional for the
long walk he had to take.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It mattered little now whether we went fast or
slow; for we were in a hospitable country, and
amongst friendly people, and ere nightfall we were
many miles beyond pursuit.</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Through the low, half-open wicket,</p>

<p class='line0'>Passing by the grave memorials</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Of departed worth and fame,</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>This</span> masterpiece of Mozart must always stand as
the highest type of musical drama. Yet most persons
who go to this famous opera for the first time, and look
over the libretto, are disappointed in a worse sense
than the travelers who complain of the first unimposing
view of Niagara. It seems to them a waste of so
much fine music, to couple it with the mere story of
a desperate rake, (a young cavalier <span class='it'>estremamente
licenzioso</span>, as he is set down in the list of characters,)
who, after running a most extravagant career, is
brought to judgment in a marvelous way; namely,
by his inviting in jest the statue of an old man whom
he had murdered, the father of the noble lady he had
sought to ruin, to sup with him; and by being surprised
in the midst of his feast by the statue in good
earnest, with the whole <span class='it'>posse comitatûs</span> of the nether
world rising to claim him! We are at a loss at first
to account for the charm of so vulgar and grotesque
a tissue of absurdities. Yet there is a meaning in it
that concerns us all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Juan is one of the permanent, traditional types
of character; and Mozart’s music sympathetically,
instinctively, rather than with any conscious philosophical
purpose, brings out the essence of it. The
gay gallant, magnetic disturber of every woman’s
peace that comes within his sphere, is not intended
for that vulgar sensualist, that swaggering street-rake,
which caricatures the part in most performances
we may have seen. The true conception of Mozart’s
Don Juan is that of a gentleman, to say the least, and
more than that, a man of genius; a being, naturally
full of glorious passion, large sympathies, and irrepressible
energies; noble in mind, in person, and in
fortune; a large, imposing, generous, fascinating
creature. Dramatically he is made a little more than
human, yet in a purely human direction. He is such
as we all are, “only more so,” to borrow an expressive
vulgarism. Remarkably is he such as Mozart
himself was. He is a sort of ideal impersonation of two
qualities, or springs of character, raised as it were to
the highest power, projected into supernatural dimensions—which
is only the poet’s and musician’s way
of truly recognizing the element of infinity in every
passion of the human soul, since not one ever finds
its perfect satisfaction. Mozart in his own life knew
them too well, these two springs or sources of excitement!
They are: (1.) the genial temperament, the
exquisite zest of pleasure, the sensibility to every
charm and harmony of sense, amounting to enthusiasm,
and content with nothing short of ecstasy;
that appetite for outward beauty, which lends such a
voluptuous, Titian coloring to his music. And (2.)
as the crowning enthusiasm of the young, fresh soul,
as the highest mortal foretaste of celestial bliss, the
sentiment of sexual love—that sentiment which is
the key-note of every opera. In Mozart, music appears
as the peculiar native language of these passions,
these experiences. His music is all fond sensibility,
pure tranquillity of rapture, and most luxurious
harmony of soul and sense; and therefore in him we
have the finest development of the dramatic element
in music. The two together make the genuine Giovanni
creed—the creed of Mozart and of Music—the
natural creed and religion of joy. This free and perfect
luxury of passion and fruition, Mozart imagines
raised (as we have said) to the highest power, in the
hero of the old tradition. His Don Juan is a grand
believer in the passions and in pleasure; he is the
splendid champion and Titan of that side of the problem
of life, a superb vindicator of the senses. He
stands before us in the glorious recklessness of self-assertion
and protests against the soul-and-passion-starving
conventionality, the one-sided, frigid spiritualism
of an artificial, priest-ridden, Mammon-worshiping
society; opposing to those meshes of restraint his
own intense consciousness of <span class='it'>being</span>, (with a blind instinct
that it is good, divine at bottom, and only
needing to appear in its own natural language of a
Mozart’s music to prove this;) strong in the faith,
against the world, that <span class='sc'>Joy, Joy</span> is the true condition
and true sign of life; but blindly seeking to realize
this in the ecstatic lawlessness of love, which necessarily
involves sooner or later a proportional reaction
of the outraged Law and Wisdom of the Universe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Excessive love of pleasure, helped by a rare magnetism
of character, and provoked by the suppressive
moralism of the times, have engendered in him a
reckless, roving, insatiable appetite, which each intrigue
excites and disappoints, until the very passion
in which so many souls are first taught the feeling of
the Infinite, becomes a fiend in his breast and drives
him to a devilish love of power that exults over woman’s
ruin, or rather, that does not mind how many
hearts and homes fall victims to his unqualified assertion
of the everywhere rejected and <span class='it'>snubbed</span> faith
in Passion. The buoyant impulse, generous and
good in the first instance, goes on thus undoubtingly,
defying bounds, till it becomes pure willfulness, and
the first flush of youth and nobleness is hardening to
Satanic features. The beauty and the loveliness of
woman have lost to him now all their sacredness;
they are mere fuel to the boundless ambition of a passion
which knows no delight beyond the brief excitement
of intrigue and sensual indulgence. He becomes
the impersonation and supernatural genius of
one of the holiest springs of human sentiment <span class='it'>perverted</span>,
because <span class='it'>denied</span>; and he roams the earth a
beautiful, terrible, resistless, fallen angel, and victim
after victim are quaffed up by his hot breath of all-devouring
passion. And so he perseveres until Hell
claims its own in the awful consummation of the
supper scene. Art could not choose a theme more
fraught with meaning and with interest. It is still the
old theme and under-current of Opera: the Body and
the Soul;<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> the Liberty of passion, unmeet for its
own guidance, in conflict with the Law, intensely
narrowed down by social custom from God’s great
law of universal harmony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The character of Don Juan, thus conceived, this
splendid embodiment of the free, perfect, unmisgiving
luxury of sense and passion, would be no character
at all, but only an absurdity, an impossibility in the
spoken drama. There is no prose about it; nothing
literal and sober; take away the exaltation, the rhythmical
nature of it, and it falls entirely to the ground.
Only Music could conceive and treat it; Music,
which is the language of the ideal, innermost, <span class='it'>potential</span>
life, and not of the actual life. But music equally
does justice to both sides of the fact. In this triumphant
career of passion, inasmuch as it is among men
and laws and sympathies and social customs, a fearful
retribution is foreshadowed. But not in <span class='it'>him</span>, not
in this Titan of the senses, this projected imagination
of unlimited enjoyment and communion. It is through
the music that the shuddering presentiment continually
creeps. Through music, which in acknowledging
the error, in laying bare the fatal discord, at the same
time symbolizes its resolution. Through music, in
whose vocabulary sin and suffering and punishment
are never final; in whose vivid coloring the great
doom itself is but a vista into endless depths of harmony
and peace and unexclusive bliss beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The splendid sinner’s end is rather melodramatic
in the opera; and yet there is a poetic and a moral
truth in it; and the spectre of the <span class='it'>Commendatore</span> is
a creation fully up to Shakspeare. No man ever literally
came to that; but many have come to dread
it. Beings, as we are, so full of energies and of exhaustless
passional promptings to all sorts of union
and acquaintance with the rest of being; urged, just
in proportion to the quantity of life in us, to seek
most intimate relationship all round, materially and
spiritually, we dread the mad excess of our own pent
up forces. Surrounded by set formulas; denied free
channels corresponding to our innate tendencies and
callings; plagued by traditions, and chafed by some
social discipline, in which the soul sees nothing it
can understand, except it be the holy principle of
Order in the abstract, do we not often start to see
what radicalism lurks in every genuine spring of life
or passion, in everything spontaneous and lovable?
Who, more than the pleasure-loving, sympathy-seeking,
generous, child-like, glorious, imaginative, sensitive,
ecstatic, sad Mozart, would be apt to shudder
in dreams, in the night solitudes of his over-worked,
and feverish and wakeful brain, before the colossal
shadow of what possibly <span class='it'>he</span> might become through
excess of the very qualities that made him diviner
than common mortals? This allegory can certainly
be traced through “Don Giovanni.” The old governor
or commander, whom he kills, personates the
Law. The cold, relentless marble statue, that stalks
with thundering foot-fall into the middle of his solitary
orgies alter him, is the stern embodiment of custom
and convention, which he defies to the end, and
boldly grasps the proffered stony hand, from an impulse
stronger than his terrors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is an old Middle-Age Catholic story. Under
many forms it had been dramatized and poetized as
a warning to sinners, before Da Ponte<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a> found it so
much to the purpose of Mozart, when he wanted to
do his best in an opera composed expressly for his
dear and own peculiar public at Prague. Coarse as
the story seems, perhaps the conflict between good
and evil in the human soul was never represented in
a better type. It was for Mozart’s music to show
that. That in adopting it for music he had any metaphysical
idea at all about it, there is no need of
supposing. His instinct found in it fine sphere for
all his many moods of passion and of music. Here
he could display all his universality of musical culture,
and his Shaksperian universality of mind. Genius
<span class='it'>does</span> its work first; the theory of it is what an
appreciating, philosophical observer must detect in
it when done. “They builded better than they
knew.” Love, if it was the ruling sentiment of Mozart’s
nature, was for that very reason his chief danger.
If it was almost his religion and taught his soul
its own infinite capacity, so also seemed the danger
therefrom infinite, raising presentiments and visions
of some supernatural abyss of ruin, yawning to receive
the gay superstructure of man’s volatile enjoyments
here in time. Life, power, love, pleasure,
crime, futurity and judgment—and a faith left beyond
<span class='it'>that!</span>—what dream more natural, what circle
of keys more obvious to modulation, to a soul, whose
strings are all attuned to love and melody, whose genius
is a powerful demon waiting on its will, and
whose present destiny is cast here in a world so false
and out of tune that, to so strong a nature, there
seems no alternative besides wild excess upon the
one hand, or a barren sublimity of self-denial on the
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this old legend the worldly and the supernatural
pass most naturally into one another. Don Juan, gifted
with all the physical and intellectual attributes of
power, urged by aspirations blind but uncontainable,
full of the feeling of <span class='it'>life</span>, and resolved to <span style='font-size:smaller'>LIVE</span>, if
possible, so fully as to fill all with himself and never
own a limit, (and this is only a perversion of the true
desire to live in harmony <span class='it'>with</span> all,) finds the tempting
shadow of this satisfaction in the love of woman,
and the poor bird flutters charmed and trembling toward
his fascinating glance. Imagine now the elegant,
full-blooded, rich, accomplished and seductive
gallant on his restless rout of pleasures and intrigues.
At his side his faithful knave, droll Leporello, expostulating
with his master very piously sometimes,
yet bound to him by potent magnetism, both of metal
and of character (for passion like Giovanni’s <span class='it'>will</span> be
served.) Leporello is the foil and shadow to his
master, and adds to the zest of his life-long intoxication
by the blending of the comic with this exquisite
wild fever of the blood. Throughout the whole he
plays the part of contrast and brings all back to
reality and earth again, lest the history should take
too serious possession of us. He is the make-weight
of common sense tossed into the lighter scale. He
justifies its original title of “Don Giovanni, <span class='it'>un
drama giocoso</span>;” for this opera is tragedy and comedy
and what you please, the same heterogeneous yet
harmonious compound that life itself is. He on the
one side gives a dash of charlatanry to Don Juan,
just as on the other side he borders on the supernatural.
Mark the poetic balance and completeness
here: this passion-life of Don Juan has its outward
and its inward comment: on the one side Leporello,
on the other the supernatural statue and the bodily
influx of hell. On the one side it is comic, grotesque
and absurd; on the other, it is fearful. Seen
in one light he is a charlatan, a splendid joke; seen
in the other, he is an unfolding demon and a type
of doom; while in his life he is but the free development
of human passion in human circumstances.
Man always walks between these two mirrors! One
shows his shadow, as of destiny, projected, ever-widening,
into the Infinite, where it grows vague
and fearful. The other takes him in the act, and
literally pins down all his high strivings and pretensions
to such mere matter of fact, that he becomes
ridiculous.</p>

<hr class='tbk117'/>

<p class='pindent'>We come now to the Opera itself, which we can
only examine very briefly and unequally, touching
here and there. Were we to set about it thoroughly,
our article would soon overflow all magazine bounds,
since there is not a scene, an air, a bit of recitative,
from the beginning to the end, that would not challenge
our most critical appreciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And first the Overture, composed, they say, in the
single night before the first public performance of the
opera in Prague; his wife keeping him awake to his
work by punch and anecdotes and fairy tales, that
made him laugh till the tears ran down his cheeks;
and only ready for the orchestra (which had not its
equal in all Europe) to play at sight without rehearsal.
He may have <span class='it'>written</span> it that night, that is to
say, have copied it out of his head. It was his habit
of composition; his musical conceptions shaped
themselves whole in his brain, and were carried
about there for days until the convenient time to put
them upon paper; and it is not possible that his brain
that time could have been without an overture, since
there the opera existed as a perfect whole, and in
that glowing and creative mood, the instrumental
theme and preface to the same must have floated
before him as naturally as the anticipation of his audience.
Moreover, the first movement of it, the
Andante, is essentially the same music with the
grand and awful finale of the opera, and is properly
put first in the overture (whose office it is to prepare
the hearer’s mind) as the grand end and moral
of the piece. Accordingly it opens with three stern,
startling crashes on the chord of D minor, the sub-bass
dividing the measure into equal halves, but the
upper parts syncopated; then a pause, and then the
same repeated in the Dommant—like the announcement
of a power not to be trifled with. Then a
series of wild modulations, full of terror, enhanced
by the unearthly brass and low reed tones, surging
through chromatic intervals, which make the blood
creep, and presently overtopped by a pleading melody
of the first violins, while a low, feeble whimper of
the second violins is heard all the time like the
moaning of the wind about an old house. Then alternate
sharp calls and low, tremulous pauses; the
ground quakes; the din becomes more fearful; the
melody begins to traverse up and down all kinds of
scales, through intervals continually shifting, and
expressive of all manner of uncertainty, like the
quick and fruitless runs in all directions of a beast
surrounded by the hunters. It is like the breaking
up of the familiar foundations of things, that unsettling
of the musical Scale!—All this is brief, for it is
but a synopsis and foreshadowing of the last scene
in the opera. The string instruments then dash off,
in the major of the key, into a wild, reckless kind of
Allegro, than which there could not be a better musical
correspondence of the general subject, that is,
of the restless, mischievous career of one outraging
all the social instincts and defying all pursuit. This
spends itself at leisure, softening at the close toward
the genial F natural, the key of nature and the
senses, where the overture is merged into the dramatic
introduction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The curtain rises. Scene, a garden in Spain.
Time, just before daybreak. Leporello, cloaked,
with a lantern, paces watchfully to and fro before a
noble villa, and sings with heavy bass of his drudgeries
and dangers in the service of his graceless
master; kindling half seriously at the thought how
fine a thing it would be to play the gallant and the
gentleman himself. The light and exquisite accompaniment
of the instruments meanwhile is like the
softness of a summer night, and seems to count the
moments of pleasure. The dreams of the valet are
soon disturbed. Don Juan, his face hid by his mantle,
rushes from the house, struggling from the grasp
of Donna Anna, who, pale and disheveled, clings to
him convulsively, and seeks to detain and to discover
the bold, mysterious man, who has dared thus to invade
her privacy and her honor. Her hurried and
accusing melody, in these snatches of recitative, is
full of a dignity and a pure and lofty fire that characterize
alike her person and the whole music of her
port. With drawn sword in one hand, and a torch
in the other, her old father, the Commendatore
(commander of a religious order) rushes out and
challenges the bravo, who deals him a death-thrust.
The startlingly vivid orchestral picture, which accompanies
and as it were guides these sword
thrusts, is followed by a slow, mournful trio of bass
voices, in which are gloomily contrasted the scornful
triumph of Don Juan, the dying wail and warning
of the old man, and the comic terror of Leporello.
Nothing could be more thrillingly impressive; that
music could mean nothing else but death stalking
suddenly into the very midst of life! Then comes
the passionate outpouring of the daughter’s grief, and
that inimitable scene of the most musical as well as
most dramatic dialogue in the whole range of the
lyric drama. It is the perfection of recitative.
What exquisite tenderness and sincerity of sorrow
in that violin figure which accompanies her inquiry
for her father, (<span class='it'>padre mio</span>,) when she first recovers
from her swoon! How sweet and comforting that
fall of the seventh, where Ottavio tells her: <span class='it'>Hai
sposo e padre in me</span> (Thou hast husband and father
in me!) And how fiery and grand the passage
where she inspires the tame lover with that sublimely
solemn oath of revenge, and the hot, scouring
blast of their swift and wonderful duett which follows
it. In all this there is no delicate touch of feeling,
no spiritual token of great passion and great purpose,
possible to voice or instruments, omitted; no note
omissible or of slight significance. Here is an opening
of most pregnant import. One scene of moderate
length has impressed us, as by the power of fate, to
the seeing through of the profoundest drama of life.
Here we have witnessed, as it were, the first reaction
of the eternal Law, the first hint of destiny in
this splendid libertine’s thus far irresistible career.
Already is this almost superhuman pleasure-hunt of
genius past its climax, and the dread note of retribution
is already sounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next scene introduces us to one of the personified
reproaches of Don Juan’s better nature. As
the Don and his man are plotting new adventures, a
lady passes, in hat and feathers, with excited air,
and, as they retreat into the shade to note her, she
pours out her most musical complaint against the
traitor who has played falsely with her heart. The
introductory symphony or ritornel, in E flat major,
by its bold and animated strain indicates the high-spirited
and passionate nature now before us, whose
song of ever constant though wronged love, to words
that would fain threaten terrible revenge, commences
the Terzetto, mainly solo, to which the mocking by-play
of the Don and Leporello, accompanied by a
mocking figure of the instruments, supplies the other
two parts. As he steps up to offer consolation to
the lady, he recognizes his own simple, loving, poor
deserted mistress, Donna Elvira, and while the same
mocking instrumental figure leaves the song hanging
in the air, as it were, without any cadence or
any close, he slips away and leaves the task of explanation
to the disconcerted servant. There is an
ardent, passionate yearning in this as in all of Elvira’s
melodies, which climb high and are perhaps
the most difficult in the opera. The character is
seldom conceived truly by the actress. Interpreted
by its music, its intention is distinct enough. Elvira
is no half-crazed, foolish thing; but one of the highest
moral elements in the <span class='it'>personnel</span> of the opera; next in
dignity, at least, to Donna Anna. However she may
appear in the libretto and in the common usage of
the stage, Mozart in his music makes her the soul
of ardent and devoted love and constancy, still fondly
hoping in the deeper, better self of the man who has
trifled with her; like a sweet, genuine ray of sun
shine, always indicating to Don Juan a chance of
escape from the dark labyrinthine fatality of crime in
which he goes on involving himself; always offering
him true love for false.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let her not listen then (like the silly girl we commonly
see upon the stage, half-magnetized out of a
weak sorrow into a weaker involuntary yielding to
the ludicrous) to the exquisitely comic appeal of
Leporello, when the vain-glorious fellow unrolls his
tremendous list of his master’s conquests among the
fair sex, enumerating the countries, ranks, styles of
beauty, etc. The melody of this “Catalogue Song”
is altogether surpassing. It is the perfection of <span class='it'>buffo</span>,
as we have before had the perfection of serious recitative.
After naming the numbers for Italy, Germany,
etc., when it comes to the climax (Elvira’s
own land): <span class='it'>Ma in Espagna mille e trè</span>, [But in
Spain one thousand and three,] it is ludicrously
grave; the orchestra meanwhile has chopped the
measure into short units, alternate instruments
just touching different points of height and depth,
till they seem at last to count it all up on the fingers,
first downward in the tripping <span class='it'>pizzicato</span> scale of the
violins, then upward in gruff confirmation in the
basses. In the slow time, where it comes to the
specification of the different qualities of beauty, the
<span class='it'>grande maëstosa</span>, the <span class='it'>piccina</span>, etc., the melody is
one of the most beautiful and pathetic that could be
imagined. One wonders how Mozart could have
expended such a wealth of melody upon so light a
theme; it seems as lavish a disproportion of means
to end, as when we read of travelers roasting their
eggs in the cinders of Vesuvius. But such was the
musical fullness and integrity of Mozart; the genial
vein, once opened, <span class='it'>would</span> run only pure gold; and his
melodies and harmonies are not merely proportioned
to the specialities of the subject, but are at every
moment moulded in the style and spirit of the whole
work. Besides, the comedy consists here in the
contrast of a pathetic melody with a grotesque
thought. Moreover the whole thing is truer in the
fact, that not only Leporello’s, but Don Juan’s own
melodies, as indeed the very nature of music, seem
mournfully to rebuke the desperado. In the most
comic and most bacchanalian strains, the music
saddens with a certain vague presentiment of the
fearful <a id='den'></a><span class='it'>dénouement</span> of the drama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Don’s next adventure is the meeting of a gay
group of peasants at a wedding festival, where he
attempts to seduce away the pretty bride, Zerlina,
whose <a id='nai'></a>naïve and delicious songs, right out of a simple,
good, loving heart, a little coquettish withal,
are among the purest gems of the piece, and have
mingled their melody with the civilized world’s conceptions
of truth and nature and the charm of innocence.
Those of our readers who have enjoyed
with us the privilege of hearing and seeing a worthy,
indeed a perfect personation of Zerlina, by that
refined and charming artist, Signora Bosio, will
need no words to give them a just conception of the
character, and of its music, which is as individual
as that of Anna or Elvira. Suffice it to say, that the
simplicity, the tenderness and the coquetry of this
pretty peasant, have the natural refinement of a
superior nature. Mozart must have been in love
with the part. The rustic chorus opening this scene,
in which the bridal pair lead off, is one of perfect
simplicity, (Allegro, 6—8 time,) and yet inimitable
beauty. The Duett, <span class='it'>La ci darem la mano</span>, in which
Don Juan overcomes the hesitation of the dazzled,
spell-bound girl, breathes the undoubted warmth of
passion; few simple souls could be proof against
such an eloquent confession. Indeed the <span class='it'>sincerity</span>
of all this music is a great part of its charm; it has
never the slightest symptom of any striving for
effect, and yet it is consummate art; it flows directly
out of the characters and situations and the dramatic
tendency of the whole. The poor girl is rescued
this time by the entrance of an experienced guardian
angel, who sees through the case at once. It is
Donna Elvira, who, just as she is tripping away with
the fascinator to the gay, consenting tune of <span class='it'>Andiam</span>,
(let us go,) snatches the bird from his hands. Her
song of warning to the simple one, <span class='it'>Ah! fuggi ’l
traditor</span>, is a strangely elaborate Handelian aria, so
different in style from the rest of the opera that it is
never performed. As if all things conspired to confound
the traitor, Donna Anna and her lover also
enter, (Zerlina having withdrawn,) and here ensues
that wonderful Quartette, <span class='it'>Non ti fidar</span>, in which
each voice-part is a character, a melody of a distinct
genius, and all wrought into a perfect unity. Elvira
warns Anna and Ottavio against confiding in this
generous-looking Don, whose aid they have unwittingly
bespoken in their search for the murderer of
the first scene (namely himself;) Don Juan declares
that she is crazy, and not to be minded; the others
are divided between pity for her and respect for
such a gentleman; and all these strands are twisted
into one of the finest concerted pieces in all opera.
It is one of those peculiar triumphs of opera which
make it so much more dramatic than the spoken
drama; for here you have four characters expressing
themselves at once, with entire unity of effect,
yet with the distinctest individuality. The music
makes you instantly clairvoyant to the whole of
them; you do not have to wait for one after the other
to speak; there is a sort of song-transparency of all
at once; the common chord of all their individualities
is struck. Especially is this achieved in the
concerted pieces, the quartettes, trios, and so forth,
of Mozart, which are beyond comparison with most
of those in the Italian opera of the day, since the
harmony in them is not the mere coloring of one
thought, but the interweaving of so many distinct
individualities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zerlina is saved, but by arrangement with her
protectors agrees to go up to the Don’s palace,
whither Leporello has conducted the whole wedding
party, and even coaxed along the jealous bridegroom.
A scene ensues between Donna Anna and
her lover. The orchestra, in a few startling and
almost discordant shrieks, indicates the intense excitement
of her mind, for, as Don Juan took his
leave, she recognized the look and voice of one
whom she had too much cause to remember; and
in impassioned bursts of hurried recitative, alternating
with the said spasmodic bits of instrumentation,
she exclaims, <span class='it'>Quegli è il carnefice del mio padre</span>,
(this man is my father’s murderer,) and in the same
grandly lyric style, rising higher and higher, she
tells Ottavio the story of her outrage. Having
reached the climax, this magnificent recitative becomes
melody, and completes itself in the sublime
Aria, <span class='it'>Or tu sai</span>, “Now thou knowest who attempted
my honor,” etc. There can be nothing greater, more
Minerva-like in dignity and high expression of the
soul of justice outraged, and at the same time full
of all feminine tenderness and beauty, in the whole
range of opera or drama. And it is Music, it is
Mozart that has done it all. We have here the character
of Donna Anna in its most sublime expression;
a character that transcends mere personal relations,
that bears a certain mystical relationship with the
higher power beginning to be felt in the development
of this human history. In this song she rises,
as it were, to the dignity of an impersonation of the
moral principle in the play, and this high sentiment
of hers is like a foretaste of the coming fate and supernatural
grandeur, which are to form the never to
be forgotten finale of the piece. Elvira is entirely in
the sphere of the personal; she <span class='it'>loves</span> Don Juan to
the last, and like the simple good humanity that still
appeals to him though still rejected. But Anna is
superhuman and divine; she reveals the interworking
of the Infinite in all these finite human affairs;
to Heaven, rather than to Ottavio, is her appeal; and
from beyond this life she looks to see the vindicator
of her cause appear. The loftiness of the music just
considered, and the stately trumpet-tones of the
orchestra, which always herald the entrance of
Donna Anna and her party, connect her unmistakably
with the marvelous elements of the drama; she
is Feeling prophesying Justice; she is Faith in the
form of woman; and the singer who could perfectly
present Donna Anna would be worthy to sing Handel’s
song, “I know that my Redeemer liveth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From one extreme we pass to its opposite. In
strongest possible contrast with the high moral passion
of this last, is what now follows. We have a
song embodying the very frenzied acme of Don
Juan’s zest of sensual pleasure. He directs Leporello
about the feast, and trolls off, like one possessed,
his famous champagne song, <span class='it'>Finch’an del vino</span>,
whose rapidity and glorious <span class='it'>abandon</span> are too much
for almost all the baritones; those, in whose dragging
utterance it does not become commonplace, are
apt to give it with a swaggering glibness, and a
coarseness that has nothing of the fine champagne
enthusiasm about it. In this song and that last of
Donna Anna’s the two electric poles, as it were, of
the whole play, have met. And now for the pretty
episode of peasant life again; the inimitably sweet,
insinuating, loving song in which repentant little
Zerlina seems to invite chastisement from her offended,
jealous lover, <span class='it'>Batti, batti, O bell’ Masetto</span>,
(beat me, beat me, dear Masetto!). With what
soft tendrils of melody, enhanced by the delicious
instrumentation, she steals around his senses and his
heart! And to what unaffected rapture (to say nothing
of a little coquettish triumph) the strain changes
when he forgives her, as she knew he would! This
seems a very simple song, but it is the perfection of
art. O that Mozart could go into ecstasies with his
own pet Zerlina, hearing Bosio sing this!</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have now reached the musical Finale of the
first act, though there is much shifting of scenes and
characters before the last grand <span class='it'>ensemble</span>, which is
the ball in the Don’s palace. But these only suspend,
to wonderfully enhance, the final stroke. We can
only enumerate the delicious series of ever new and
characteristic musical ideas preliminary to the feast:
(1.) Masetto urging Zerlina to hide herself—how full
of the bustle of approaching splendors is the music
during this little hurried duett! (2.) The Don’s
voice stimulating the peasants to the coming mirth,
with their responsive chorus. (3.) Then his discovery
of the shy bird and half reclaimal of her love,
with his blank surprise (so perfectly depicted in the
sudden modulation of the music) as he leads her off
only to meet the watchful bridegroom: <span class='it'>Masetto si,
Masetto</span>! (during all which the light twittering
phrases of the accompaniment make the whole atmosphere
instinct with joys expected.) (4.) Then,
as the instruments suddenly change to a cautious,
half-hushed, tip-toe melody, unflagging in its speed,
yet in the minor mood, (for these have no festivity
in their hearts that now come) the entrance of
Donna Elvira, Donna Anna, and Don Ottavio, in
black dominos, and masked to the outward eye,
though each betrayed by a distinctive style of melody.
(5.) Then the sounding (from within the house) of
that stately <span class='it'>minuett</span>, a strain which everybody knows
and loves, and still as fresh as when first written,
here introduced as a mere foretaste of itself, and of
the ball, and made the musical ground-work of lordly
courtesy and hospitality to the salutations of Don Juan
and Leporello, who appear above at the window,
and invite the maskers in. (6.) The surpassing Trio,
in which the three, lingering on the threshold, invoke
Heaven’s protection to innocence ensnared.
Can any other opera show such an exuberance of
musical ideas in the same space? And it is all <span class='it'>en passant</span>,
all incidental to what follows, to what now bursts
instantly upon the view as the back scene is withdrawn,
and you see all the crowd and splendor of
the ball-room, and are transported by the indescribably
rich Finale, that ever climbing, widening
<span class='it'>crescendo</span> and accumulation of all musical effects,
till the climax is reached in a general storm and inundation
of harmony. The simple, gay, continuous
six-eight melody, to which the whole brilliant spectacle
moves at first, is the very soul of festivity.
Suddenly there is a full chord in C from the whole
orchestra, with trumpets, and a stately, march-like
strain, preluding the entrance of the three in masks,
with the lordly welcome of the Amphytrion. He
will have no time lost, however, for into this one
high hour he has concentrated all the delights and
harmonies of sense—short, bright and strong be the
blood-quickening chorus, <span class='it'>Viva la liberta!</span> and now
let the dance go on. And now are crowded into a
brief but most capacious moment, the reintroduction
of the Minuett in a bolder key than before, to whose
grave, deliberate measure the more elegant company
begins to move in antique, solemn steps; then presently,
commingling with the Minuett, but not disturbing
it, two other tunes, to other rhythms, namely,
a rustic contra-dance, and a most rapid waltz, inspiring
the heels of the peasants; the droll attempts
of Leporello to make Masetto dance, while his
master has bespoken the arm and ear of the pretty
bride, to win whom he has planned this whole array;
the indignant observation of this game by Donna
Anna, with difficulty moderated until due time by
her companions; the piercing shriek of the music as
Don Juan whirls Zerlina away out of the dance; the
cry for aid; the general rush to the door whence
the sounds proceed, and when it is broken in, the
grotesque brief diversion of the Don dragging Leporello
by the ear, and trying to fasten his own crime
on him; the incredulous and accusing phrase, in
which the voices of the trio, now unmasked, confront
him successively in <span class='it'>Canon</span> style; and the out-bursting
of the general tempest of wrath upon the
exposed deceiver, heightened, too, by the sweeping
wind and hissing lightnings of an actual physical
storm that is supposed to be passing without. The
strength of the accusing chorus is splendidly terrific,
and like the rush of a whirlwind, where all the voices
in unison swiftly traverse up and down several times
the first five notes of the scale. But he of the dauntless
will and the magnetic eye, with one sword awes
back and penetrates the maddened mob, escaping
with a loud laugh of defiance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our very slight and hasty sketch has already grown
to considerable length, and yet we have examined
only one act of the three, into which “Don Giovani”
is usually divided in the performance. One
act was enough to show (if <span class='it'>that</span> were all our object)
how this opera wells up as from an exhaustless
fountain of musical ideas, all of which are of the inspired,
enduring quality; we have listened to materials
enough already for some twenty of the fashionable
operas of our day. We must glance more
hastily at the remainder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Act II. opens with one of those half humorous,
half serious conversations between the Don and Leporello,
which ever and anon relieve the story. The
servant, stung by the ungrateful and outrageous conduct
of his master in the ball-room explosion, announces
his determination to quit him; but they are
too essential to each other, and the Don soon coaxes,
laughs, and bribes him out of that notion. This
duett is in real Italian <span class='it'>parlando</span> style, a syllable to
every note, quick and brief as it is comically expressive;
for this enemy of woman’s peace has new
business on hand; the unlucky night is not too far
gone to try one more adventure. So here follows
the summer warmth and beauty of the serenade
scene under Donna Elvira’s window, who sits above
there, pouring out her nightingale complainings under
the stars, in a melody of ravishing sweetness and
tenderness, forming the upper part of a <span class='it'>Terzetto</span>, in
which the <span class='it'>sotto voce</span> dialogue of the Don and his
man below grotesquely blends. He changes garments
with Leporello, and lending his own voice,
while Leporello gesticulates, in strains of feigned
repentance and returning love, entices the too easily
persuaded lady down into the arms of his counterfeit,
while he takes up his guitar to serenade, not
Elvira, but Elvira’s maid, now that the field is clear,
in that most graceful little serenading air, which
seems so easy and so off-hand, with its light <span class='it'>arpeggio</span>
accompaniment by violins alone: <span class='it'>Deh vieni alla
finestra</span>. But the fortunate stars of our all-seducing
hero seem this night to have forsaken him; again
his business is balked. Mirth and melody, fun
and sentiment are strangely mingled in this scene,
and, indeed, in this whole act. The serenade gets
finished; the tree, as it were, is climbed; but before
the fruit can be gathered, the game is interrupted by
Masetto and the peasants armed, hot from the ball-room
scene, in search of the splendid scoundrel.
Masetto gets the worst of it; and here we have one
of the world’s three or four very choicest and purest
gems of melody, Zerlina’s exquisitely tender and
comforting song to her poor, bruised, and beaten
bridegroom, <span class='it'>Vedrai carino</span>; so beautifully simple,
in the homely key of C natural; so innocently voluptuous;
so full of blissful love; so like the balsam
(<span class='it'>un certo balsamo</span>) of which she hints with fond and
arch significance! And as she makes him place
his hand upon her heart at the words, <span class='it'>sentilo battere</span>,
(feel it beat,) you seem to hear its glad and honest
beating in the music. We cannot forbear inserting
here the following interpretation of this song, which
we have read since our analysis of the opera was
made. It is from the pen of an intelligent Russian
gentleman, who has written in French and German
an admirable Life of Mozart, with a critical examination
of his works. We translate from the German
copy:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Vedrai Carino</span> is, like so many pieces of our
opera, super-dramatic music. When we hear it, we
forget the text, we forget the person. There is no
longer any Zerlina or Masetto. Something infinite,
absolute, and verily divine announces itself to the
soul. Is it perhaps nothing but love, represented
under one of the countless modifications by which
it is distinguished in each individual, according to
the laws of his nature, and the peculiar vicissitudes
of his fortune? No; the soul feels rather a direct
effluence of the principle itself, from which all
youth, all love, all joy, and every vital reproduction
flows. The genius of the Spring’s metamorphoses,
he namely, whom the old theosophists called <span class='sc'>Eros</span>,
who disembroiled chaos, who fructified germs and
married hearts; this genius speaks to us in this
music, as he has so often spoken in the murmurings
of the brook that has escaped its icy prison, in the
rustling of the young leaves, in the melodious songs
of the nightingale, in the balmy odors which pervade
the eloquent and inspiring stillness of a May
night. <span class='sc'>Mozart</span> had listened to and firmly held this
ground-accord of this universal harmony; he arranged
it for a soprano voice with orchestral accompaniment,
and made of it the nuptial air of a young bride.
Zerlina sings, surrounded by the shadows of the
marriage night, while just about to cross the threshold,
at which virginity pauses with prayer and
trembling, expecting the confirmation of the holy
title of wife. In this place the Aria becomes a genuine
<span class='it'>scena</span> of love, the source of life and of eternal rejuvenescence
for all nature—of love, the spring-time
of souls, and the most unstinted revelation of the
all-goodness of the Creator. It is a marriage-song
for all that loves, conceived in the same spirit with
the ‘Ode to Joy’ by <span class='sc'>Schiller</span>, allowing for the
difference of tone and style between a Dithyrambic
and an Eclogue. The theme, the image of the purest
bliss, betrays none the less that inexplicable and
seldom justified exaltation, which, in the fairest
poetic hours of our existence, leads us to that unknown
good whereof all other goods of earth are
only shadows and foretastes. A rhythm without
marked accent; a harmony without dissonances; a
modulation which rests in the Tonic, and forgets
itself, as if held fast there by a magic spell; a melody
which cannot separate itself from its ineffaceable
<span class='it'>motiv</span>; this tranquil rapture, this soft ecstasy, fill
out the first half of the air. After the pause, hosts
of nightingales begin to sing in chorus in the orchestra,
while the voice, with exquisite monotony,
murmurs, <span class='it'>Sentilo battere, toccami quà</span>. Then the
same words are again uttered with the expression of
passion; the heart of the young woman beats
stronger and stronger; the sighs of the orchestra are
redoubled, and the last vocal phrase, which bears
the impress of chaste devotion, shows us the wife as
she sinks softly upon the bosom of her husband.
<span class='sc'>Mozart</span> seems to have anticipated the desire of the
ear, in that he lets the orchestra repeat the whole
<span class='it'>motiv</span> and the enchanting final phrases once again.
He knew that the piece would be found too short, as
it actually is the case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Good-night, then, to this happy couple, whom we
leave, to trace the sequel of the comic vein just
opened in that ‘Sartor’-ian exchange of personality
between the master and the servant; but also at the
same to receive still more distinct and solemn intimations
(all the more significant for this very contrast
of the comic) of the supernatural reaction that is preparing
soon to burst upon the head of the magnificent
libertine and outlaw. The Sextette which now follows
is altogether unique and unrivaled among concerted
pieces in opera. The music of this Sextette
covers such an ever-shifting variety of action, and
so much of a <span class='it'>scene</span>, that one may hear it once without
thinking of its wealth and admirable structure as
music. Yet for every point in all this action, and
for all shades of relation between the persons, as well
as for each separate personality, there is a correspondence
in the music. The scene has changed to
a <span class='it'>bujo loco</span>, or dark place, (the libretto says, a porch
to Donna Anna’s palace.) First appear the counterfeit
Giovanni and Elvira, who is too happy to walk with
him to the end of the world, if need be; while he,
(Leporello,) tired of imitating his master’s voice, is
groping about to find an exit. In an Andante melody,
in the same key, and of a kindred character with that
by which we first knew her (<span class='it'>Ah! chi mi dice mai</span>,)
she utters her fear of being left alone in this bujo loco.
Just as her companion finds the door, the groping,
cautious music brightens into the bold key and trumpet-style
which always heralds Anna and Ottavio,
who enter amid blaze of torches. Sweet is the consoling
appeal of the <span class='it'>tenore</span> to his grief-stricken Anna,
whose response, less fiery and commanding, but not
less sublimely spiritual than her last great solo, even
hints of death as the only solution of life’s riddle for
her. Meanwhile the first two, who have lurked unnoticed,
are just making good their exit, when Zerlina
and Masetto appear, who thinks that now he
has the <span class='it'>briccone</span> at his mercy; the bluster of Masetto,
the surprise of Anna and Ottavio at the sight of
the supposed Giovanni, the grotesque, crouching
plea of the valet, the intercession of still deceived
Elvira for “her husband,” then their recognition
of <span class='it'>her</span>, then a new brandishing of Masetto’s
club, and then the ass throwing off the lion’s skin,
and begging mercy, all are made thrice expressive
by the music, which varies instinctively each moment,
and yet ceases not to weave the unitary complex
whole. At last all the six voices join in a
swift and wind-like Allegro, in which Anna’s voice
takes the highest and most florid part, Zerlina’s the
second, Elvira’s the third, and so on, and in which
there is now and then a wild Æolian-harp-like passage
of harmony, which seems the fore-feeling of the
higher powers which henceforth are to take part in
the drama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But first we have the masterpiece and model of
all tenor solos. In it Ottavio commends his <span class='it'>Il mio
tesoro</span> to the care of these friends, and in it he proves
himself the truest, tenderest, most devoted and most
religious of lovers, if Heaven <span class='it'>has</span> reserved it to a
stronger force than his to crush the mighty sinner
against whom he has taken such an oath of vengeance.
But the opera could not rob itself of the
statue, and its last scene, and its whole sublimity, to
make him a hero, when it was enough that he should
know how to <span class='it'>love</span> a Donna Anna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passing over a duett between Leporello and Zerlina,
rarely sung, in fact an after-thought of the composer,
which he is said to have added to conciliate
the lower taste of a Viennese manager or audience;
and passing over (for we must be brief) a truly transcendent
solo for Elvira: <span class='it'>Mi tradi quell’ alma ingrata</span>,
in whose fluid, ever-modulating melody her
musing, sad soul seems dissolved in reverie, we
come to the marvelous church-yard scene. Here
glimmers the white equestrian statue of the murdered
commander in the back-ground; and here the
Don and Leporello seek a rendezvous after their new
discomfiture, to re-exchange hats and mantles, and so
forth. Their loud levity is suddenly hushed by a
voice of warning from the statue, accompanied in
strange chords by the unearthly tones of the trombones
(which instruments, instead of being lavished
in Verdi fashion, upon all the strong passages, have
been entirely kept back till now for this supernatural
“beginning of the end,”) mingled with the low reed
tones. <span class='it'>Di rider finirai</span>, etc. (“Thou shalt cease
to laugh before dawn!”) A short old choral strain,
in which the voice ends, spectral-like, upon the Dominant
of the key (A minor), struck with the major
Third. This is a church cadence; it belongs to eternity,
which knows no Minor, no such type of “earthly
un-rest.” It freezes to the heart of Don Giovanni,
who starts dismayed, but only for a moment; and
soon the marble lips break silence once more to rebuke
his mockery. So far it has been introductory
recitative; but now the orchestra is all life and melody
again, for the luscious music of the duett in
which Giovanni compels the trembling servant at
the sword’s point to salute the statue and invite him
to sup with him. There is no more exquisite fairy-work
in the whole opera than the instrumentation
of this scene. It were hard to tell whether the impression
left by it partakes most of the comic, of the
supernaturally terrible, or of the beautiful. All these
elements are grotesquely blended in it, yet without
seeming incongruity. The beauty of the music harmonizes
and idealizes the action; it lends its singular
fascination to the marvelous; it makes the terror
doubly real, by expressing the vague charm which
every terror has after all to the soul, glad (even in its
terror) of the excitement of something altogether
strange and infinite. Mozart knew better than to
freeze the blood up here entirely, with unearthly
tones of horror, except during those brief utterances of
the marble rider; that he reserved for the end, of
which this is but the beginning. He has lavished
all the luxury of melodic invention upon the instrumentation
of this duett; the music in the main still
gushes warm and genial and human, and hence you
feel the supernatural all the more inwardly and powerfully,
when shudders of strange awe cross occasionally
its placid, sparkling flow. <span class='it'>O statua gentillissima</span>—cheerily
and bravely the beautiful strain
sets out, in the rich key of E major; but as the knave
shrinks back in terror, crying <span class='it'>padron! mirate!</span> etc.,
the deprecating expression of his voice dropping
through the interval of a Seventh, with the instruments
accompanying in unison, is alike droll and
marvelous. Still the cheerful melody goes on, in
spite of ghosts, until the statue nods acceptance,
when the unearthly modulation and <span class='it'>tremolo</span> of the
music, falling with sudden emphasis upon Leporello’s
<span class='it'>Ah! — —h! che scena!</span> (Ah! what a sight!), gives
the whole scene for the time the superstitious coloring
of his soul. But when he comes to tell his master
how the spectre nodded, and when his master repeats
the strain and gesture with him, the fear has
become subordinate to the charm of adventure, and
the music takes the gay and reckless tone of Giovanni.
Life shall be all a feast, is <span class='it'>his</span> creed, ghosts
and miracles to the contrary; and festally the bright
strain dies away, softer and softer, as they depart, to
the tune of <span class='it'>Andiamo via di qua</span> (let us quit this
place), to which the servant’s voice chimes in as second
very heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the curtain usually falls, closing a second
Act, although the composer covers the homeward
flight of the pair, fatigued and hungry with that night’s
adventures and discomfitures, and the preparation of
the supper, by a beautiful and elaborate recitative
and aria of Donna Anna, addressed to her devoted
Ottavio, whose urgent plea for the consummation of
their union she tenderly puts off, as with a presentiment
that her love is to know no earthly consummation,
and that her life is already too much of the
other world. This song: <span class='it'>Non mi dir</span>, bloomed one
of the heavenliest and purest in the wreath of Jenny
Lind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Act Third is the grand Finale, with its tremendous
music, its apparition, its supernatural vindication of
the Law, and the splendid sinner’s doom. Remember,
day has not dawned yet since that other
Finale, to the First Act; their supper that time was
stormily broken off, and they <a id='had'></a>have had little rest in
the mean time. But they have got home at last, and
<span class='it'>Gia la mensa è preparata</span>: now the supper is prepared;
a smart and animated strain of full orchestra
in the bold key of D. The Don has shut himself in
by himself with all the harmonies of sense and appetite;
it is the pure feast of egoism; there are no
guests, but his own appetites and riotous imaginations,
for whom all things are provided; and little
thinks he of the guest whom he <span class='it'>has</span> invited!
Droll Leporello, now all appetite, is in attendance,
devouring furtive morsels of the rich dishes, and uncorking
the champagne, (a situation commonly too
tempting to our buffo, who makes the fun excessively
and disgustingly broad,) and making broad allusions
to the <span class='it'>barbaro appetito</span> of his master. There is a
band of wind instruments, too, from whom all the
while proceed the most enlivening appeals to composite
enjoyment, in a succession of rare morsels of
melody from well-known operas of the time, for
which both master and man show an appreciating
ear. The last of these is the famous <span class='it'>Non piu andrai</span>,
from Mozart’s own “Nozze di Figaro,” to which
Leporello may well exclaim: “That I know too
well.” Through all this the Titian-like, voluptuous
quality of Mozart comes out afresh. It is the music
of pure, unalloyed sensuous enjoyment; not a shadow
of aught serious or sentimental comes over its
harmony, until once more his better nature makes
one final appeal, entreating him to repentance, in the
person of poor, constant Donna Elvira, who suddenly
rushes in and kneels at his feet. But the Don
laughs at her simple lecture, and preaches up to her
his bacchanalian gospel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here mark a fine point in the action, a fine touch
of poetic truth, worthy of Mozart’s genius. It is <span class='it'>she</span>,
his better nature, as we have said, his own rejected
truer self, who loves him better than he loves himself;
it is she, Elvira, who, as she leaves the stage,
is the first to meet the fearful apparition and by her
shriek give warning. That shriek, thrown into the
music, has suddenly changed its smooth, sparkling
surface into fierce boiling eddies, and stirred up the
whole sea of harmony from its profoundest depths.
The musicians on the stage have vanished. No time
now for their toy melodies! Every chord now
cleaves the dark veil of the supernatural, like lightnings
in the blackest night; the syncopated rhythm
tells of vague and wonderful forebodings. <span class='it'>Che grido
è questo?</span> (What noise is this?) And Leporello is
sent out to see. Wilder and heavier grows the music,
as he returns white and speechless, and only able
in his half-wittedness of terror to imitate with his
feet the heavy <span class='it'>ta, ta</span>, the approaching foot-fall of the
man of marble, who has descended from his charger
in the grave-yard. It requires the master’s hardihood
to open the door for him, and amid those solemn and
terrific crashes of the orchestra, with which the overture
commenced, the strange guest stalks into the
middle of the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With hard, ponderous, marble tones, like blows,
falling whole octaves, the statue announces himself
as good as his word in accepting Giovanni’s invitation.
The amazed unbeliever, trembling and yet
summoning up his whole pride of will, which never
yet forsook him, would fain prove as good as <span class='it'>his</span>
word, too, and orders Leporello, who has crawled
away under the table, to get ready another supper.
But “not on mortal food feeds” this guest from the
other world; “graver concerns” have led him here;
and the instruments are again traversing those <span class='it'>unsettled</span>
scales, whose wonderful effect we noticed in the
overture. <span class='it'>Parla, parla</span>: rings out the rich, fresh
baritone of the dauntless Amphytrion, as much as to
say: “talk on, old fellow! I listen; you are a ghost,
but I am a substance; I believe in myself, say what
you will.” All very brave! but listen to the orchestra
(as you cannot <span class='it'>help</span> listening) if you would know
how nevertheless it goes with him in the inner workings
of his soul, in those mysterious depths of consciousness
which hitherto he has so wilfully refrained
from sounding. That heavy, muffled tread of the
sub-bass in triplets, making the ground quake, means
more than the “tertian ague” of poor Leporello
there, with head thrust out cautiously from under
the table, and voice, automaton-like, moving in unison
with the <span class='it'>basso profondo</span> of the orchestra. A
pause is filled with a monotonous beat of the basses,
when the crashing diminished-seventh chords begin
anew, and louder than before, while the spectre
again opens its marble jaws to tender the Don an invitation
in its turn, which he, stout-hearted to the
last, in spite of Leporello’s trembling, grotesque
warnings, accepts. The statue asks his hand in
pledge; he boldly gives it, starts as if an infinite
pang and sense of death shot from the cold, stony
hand through all the marrow of his bones; with an
infinite audacity of will he refuses to repent; the
spectre sinks through the ground; he is a doomed
one; the flames of hell burst in on every side, with
visions of the damned; a chorus of spectres: <span class='it'>vieni!</span>
(come!) is heard amid the infernal whirl and tempest
of the music; he wrestles with the demons and drops
dead, the whole phantasmagoria vanishing, just as
the other characters of the piece come in search of
the reprobate, who listen to Leporello’a chattering
story, dispose of their several destinies after the approved
fashion of dramatic conclusions, and wind
up with chanting a solemn canon over the <span class='it'>Dissoluto
punito</span>, to the words: “Such is the end of the
evil-doer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is usual, however, to terminate the performance
with the fall of Giovanni. The parts which follow,
although admirable as music, are plainly superfluous
to the action, as a poetic and artistic whole, and
must have been added by Mozart out of mere conformity
to old dramatic usage, which assembles and
disposes of all the surviving characters of a piece in
the last scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is great room for melodramatic nonsense
and <span class='it'>diablerie</span> in this judgement scene, in which the
theatres have used full license. But if the orchestra
be complete and efficient, there is no possibility of
travestying or perverting the sublime and terrible intention
of the music, which from the moment that
the statue enters is enough to freeze one’s blood, and
preoccupies all avenues of sense or consciousness
with supernatural and infinite suggestions. And yet
does Music’s sweet and faithful prophecy of reconciliation,
like the “still, small voice” out of the inmost
heart of things, still reach us somehow through
it all!</p>

<hr class='tbk118'/>

<p class='pindent'>The reader, who has followed us through this review
of “Don Giovanni,” clinging always to the
musical thread of interpretation, will find himself as
little able as ourselves to sympathize with the regret,
so frequently expressed, that Mozart should have
prostituted his genius in this composition, by the
false marriage of so much divine music with an unworthy
subject. We believe the marriage was a
true one. He did not merely cater to a low, licentious
taste, in the selection of this story. Never was
a choice made more heartily. Or, if he did not himself
<span class='it'>choose</span> the plot, yet he <span class='it'>fell in</span> most heartily, and
as it were, by a providential correspondence with
the invention of Da Ponte—as heartily as he afterward
fell in with the terrific images of the old Latin
hymn, when he composed his own “Requiem,” in
writing a Requiem to order for another. In these
two works the life and genius of Mozart found their
highest expression. “Don Juan” and the “Requiem,”
in all their contrast, are alike true to the
very texture and temper of the man. “Don Juan,”
written in the hey-day of his genial faculties, in his
hour and scene of greatest outward success, in the
city of Prague, where he was understood and loved
as nowhere else, surrounded by devoted friends, and
with an orchestra and troup of singers worthy to
be his interpreters, represents his sunny side, his
keen sensibility to all refined delights of sense and
soul, and his great faith in joy, in ecstasy, in all material
and sensual harmonies. The “Requiem”
bears to “Don Juan,” as a whole, the same relation
that the last scene of that opera bears to the preceding
parts; it expresses the religious awe and mystery
of his soul, his singular presentiment of death,
his constant feeling of the Infinite. The opera, in its
last scene, rises to a sphere of music kindred with
the “Requiem;” there vibrated the same deep
chords of his nature. It was the very subject of all
others for him to pour the whole warm life-tide of
his soul and music into, and thus lift up and animate
a poor old literal fiction, that somehow strangely
kept its hold upon the popular mind, with all its
weight of grotesqueness, extravagance, vulgarity and
tom-foolery, into a vivid drama of the whole impetuous,
bewildered, punished, yet far-hoping and
indomitable experiment of human life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here are the two elements which seem in contradiction.
Here, on the one side, is this bold, generous
passion-life, with its innate gospel of joy, and transport,
and glorious liberty; how well could Mozart
understand it, and how eloquently preach it in that
safe, universal dialect of <span class='sc'>Music</span>, which utters only
the heart-truth, and not the vulgar perversion of any
sentiment! Here, on the other hand, is the stern
Morality of being, frowning in conflict with the
blind indulgence of the first. The first is false by
its excess, by losing Order out of sight; while Order,
sacred principle, in its common administration between
men, in its turn is false, through its blind
method of suppression and restraint, blaspheming and
ignoring the divine springs of passion, which it should
accept and regulate. The music is the heavenly and
prophetic mediator that resolves the strife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hence the music of “Don Giovanni” presents two
sides, two parts in strongest contrast. Love, joy,
excitement, freedom, the complete life of the senses,
are the theme of the first part, represented in the
keen and restless alternation of the Don’s intrigues and
pleasures—a downright, unmistrusting, beautiful assertion
of the natural man—and you have it all
summed up to one text and climax, in the first
Finale, in the brief champagne sparkle and stormy
transport of the little chorus, <span class='it'>Viva la</span> <span class='sc'>Liberta</span>! As
the burden of that part is <span class='sc'>Liberty</span>, so the burden
of the last part, the counter-text and focus, is
<span class='sc'>Order</span>, the violated <span class='sc'>Law</span>; and as the central
figure here stalks in the supernatural statue, stony
and implacable. It is the whole story of life, the
one ever-repeated, although ever-varied drama of
dramas; and it is set forth here, both sides of it,
most earnestly in this sincere and hearty music,
which in its own exhaustless beauty hints the reconciliation
of the two principles, and to the last is
true to the divine good of the senses and the passions,
and to the presentiment of a pure and perfect
state, when these shall be, not dreaded, not suppressed,
but regulated, harmonized, made rhythmical
and safe, and more than ever lifesome, and spontaneous
by Law as broad and deep and divine us
themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do we defy the moral of the matter, when we
feel a certain thrill of admiration as Don Juan boldly
takes the statue’s hand, still strong in his life-creed,
however he may have missed the heavenly method
in its carrying out, and somehow inspired with the
conviction that this judicial consummation is not,
after all, the end of it; but that the soul’s capacity
for joy and harmony is of that god-like and <span class='it'>asbestos</span>
quality that no hells can consume it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don Giovanni” was composed in 1787. The Abbé
Da Ponte, who wrote the book, and who enjoyed at Vienna
the same distinction with Metastasio as a writer of
musical poetry, died in New York, in December 1838, at
the age of 90 years, in a state of extreme destitution.
For thirty years he had sought a living in that city by
teaching the Italian language.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> Lord Protector was seated beneath a royal
canopy in the lofty parliament-chamber of England.
At his left stood Thurloe, his secretary, on his right
was seated a part of the bold Puritan band who had
dared affix their signatures to the death-warrant of
Charles Stuart. There was Bradshaw, the intrepid
judge who wrote his name first on that fatal paper;
there was Ireton—the fiery-hearted Ireton—who had
come up in defense of Protestantism fierce and
raging “as a lion from the swelling of Jordan;”
Goffe, and Whalley, and Dixwell, too, were there,
whose ashes repose in our own quiet “City of
Elms,” and many others of that fearless band of regicides
that three years after were fleeing from home
and country, to escape the block or gibbet. Ambassadors
from every nation were there—princes and
courtiers, officers of the army, judges, petitioners,
all helped to make up the illustrious Protectorate
Assembly of 1655.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seated side by side, and discoursing in low tones
of the projected treaty, were Sir Matthew Hale and
Milton, the world-renowned bard; and in a listening
posture near them, was the accomplished Lambert.
No purple robe or kingly crown distinguished the
chief of this august body, but nature had stamped a
seal on him that could not be mistaken, for Oliver
Cromwell bore in the parliament-hall the look and
bearing of a man born to command, while at the
same time the most unconquerable determination
and the highest-wrought enthusiasm were traced on
every lineament of his face. But to our story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gentleman, in the splendid dress that distinguished
the court of Louis Fourteenth, approached
the Lord Protector, and bending low, presented a
paper to his highness. It was Bordeaux, the French
ambassador, and the treaty so long in contemplation
between the two nations, was this day to receive
the seal of the Protectorate. The hand of Cromwell
was already on the paper, when some confusion
near the door arrested his attention, and a frown
was gathering on his brow, when his piercing eye
detected a youth with foreign air and aspect boldly
striving to make his way through the guards that
were stationed near the entrance of the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence, guards!” shouted the deep, nasal voice
of the Protectorate, “stay not the boy; let him approach
our presence if he have petition to offer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guards gave way, and a slender but graceful-looking
youth of some fourteen years came forward,
and, knelt at the feet of the sovereign. Every eye
was fastened upon him, and a deep silence came
over the throng as he knelt there with clasped hands,
his dark, earnest eyes fixed on the stern-looking,
shaggy-browed Puritan in mute supplication—for
no word fell from the boy’s lips. A heavy mass of
raven curls were gathered back from the snowy
forehead of the strange youth, and fell in singular
beauty over his shoulders, and his simple peasant
garb, had forced the idea of some wandering minstrel-boy,
but for the deep and earnest pleading of
the eyes, which told of excitement and anguish too
deep for the utterance of the lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The silent but impassioned pleading of the poor
youth touched the susceptible heart of Cromwell,
and he laid his hand kindly and caressingly on the
locks of the fair stranger, and said, in his gentlest
accents,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whence come you, my son, and how can the
Protectorate aid you? Be calm,” added he, noticing
a nervous tremor on his countenance, “you have
nothing to fear here—speak your errand plainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am come from the valley of Piedmont, my
noble lord,” replied the youth, “and the snow was
red with the blood of the poor Vaudois;” and a
cold shudder passed over his pale face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell and furies!” shouted Cromwell, in momentary
wrath; “Are the cursed heretics on their
track again?” Then bursting into tears, he added,
in a subdued tone, “Poor martyred saints of the
Most High, ye shall wear a glorious crown, in spite
of your persecutors, and your blood shall not redden
the Alpine snows in vain! If there is might in human
arm, your enemies shall be humbled, and know
that the Lord of Hosts will avenge his elect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then taking up the paper on which the sovereign
seal was not yet fixed, he delivered it to the French
ambassador, saying somewhat haughtily, “Take it
back to your monarch, and tell him that Oliver
Cromwell, Lord Protector of England, rejects the
treaty, until the King of France, and his prime minister,
shall pledge their assistance in succoring the
persecuted Protestants of Piedmont! Until such
pledge shall be given, our negotiations are ended.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bordeaux reddened with resentment as he folded
the rejected paper. “The war is then inevitable,”
he muttered. “Shall I say, sire, that you refuse
the treaty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say I will wage war with all Europe but this
persecution of Christians shall cease!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the King of France can do nothing, my
lord,” persisted Bordeaux. “The Duke of Savoy
may make laws for his subjects as independently as
your highness; and no foreign force can be brought
to bear upon them in those mountain wilds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cromwell stamped his foot with impatience.
“My word has gone forth, and ‘the ships of England
shall sail over the Alps,’ sooner than another hair
of their heads shall perish! Tell <span class='it'>both your masters</span>
that this is my decree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Frenchman was indignant at this speech of
the Lord Protector, for although every Frenchman
understood that Mazarin, the prime minister, was
the real monarch, they could not endure to have it
thus thrown in their teeth, and he angrily asked permission
to retire, which was readily granted; and
the parliament was soon after adjourned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That same evening young Francois Waldo—for
that was the name of the Vaudois youth—sat in the
palace of Whitehall, with the Protector and his
family; and though but a simple peasant-boy, he
looked with a calm indifference upon the courtly
splendor that surrounded him; for he had been bred
amid the wild magnificence of the snow-capped
Alps, and they pictured to his youthful imagination
the “everlasting hills,” of which he had early
been taught to sing, as he sat with the pious
shepherds tending their flocks in the evening starlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a sad story he told of his poor, persecuted
people, how, in the very heart of winter, six stout Catholic
regiments had broken in upon their quiet homes,
to overpower and destroy; how the innocent children
had been dashed from the icy pinnacles—the fathers
and mothers beheaded—their villages burned to the
ground—and those who fled for safely to the mountain-caverns,
were hunted like wild beasts by the
Pope’s minions; and Cromwell—the lion warrior
and the dauntless regicide—the unflinching patriot,
and the powerful sovereign, clasped the poor fugitive
to his heart, and loudly bewailed the fate of
these martyred Christians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had you parents, and were they victims of this
terrible slaughter?” weepingly inquired Mary Cromwell,
one of the Protector’s daughters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, lady—parents; and a sweet little blue-eyed
sister, like the little girl by your side;” and
he pointed to a beautiful child that had been
listening with a sorrowful face, and eyes brimfull,
to his sad recital. “We called her our mountain
violet; but in one night I was left alone—for
they burned our cottage, and slew both parents
and child. I was away, but came next morning and
sat awhile by the mouldering embers of my home,
and then rose up determined to seek the shores of
Christian England, and plead for succor. I hid
myself among the rocks and cliffs by day, and at
night wandered, hungry and alone, until I reached
the sea-coast, lest I should fall into the hands of the
soldiers, and none escape to carry aid to my suffering
nation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a brave, blessed boy, and you shall not go
hungry any more,” said little Anna Temple, forgetting
her childish timidity; and going up close to him,
she gazed earnestly and lovingly in his face. “Stay
here, and we will <span class='it'>all</span> love you, because you have
no sister—wont we, Mary?” said the child, in the
warmth and innocency of her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, darling,” replied she, “and he shall go to
school, if he wishes, with you and Robert, and
Eugene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heart of Francois Waldo was nigh to bursting,
as the gentle accents of the child fell on his ear—so
like the tones of his own Christine, which had so
often gladdened him in their happy home—and he
bowed his head and wept for the first time since his
bereavement; and every member of that lordly household
wept in sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Months went by, and the Vaudois youth was still
an inmate of the Protector’s family—a calm, intellectual,
devoted student, destined as a preacher of
that faith for which his kindred had suffered martyrdom.
He went not back to his native valley, for
here he might better fit himself for the work of the
glorious mission he felt desirous of fulfilling; and
Cromwell had been true to his word—the arm of
oppression had been unnerved, and peace and plenty
secured to the faithful survivors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anna Temple was the only earthly being that
withdrew his thoughts for a moment from the prosecution
of his great and holy purpose; but when her
soft blue eyes pleaded, as they often did, with her
lips, for an hour’s relaxation and amusement in the
park or garden, he would sometimes unbind the
mental chain for a little space, and go forth with
spirit unfettered and free. Then he would talk to
the fair child of his lost home—of the icy palaces of
the Alps, pure as spirit-haunts—of the wild-flowers
springing from their rocky beds, and of the holy starlight
of the mountains, until the enthusiastic creature
would regard Francois as a being of purer mould,
more spiritual and good, than any other person with
whom she held companionship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus years passed; Francois still saw in the
beautiful Anna Temple, or fancied he saw, the
image of his lost Christine; and the young girl read
in the large, soul-earnest eyes of the Vaudois student,
the first mysterious leaf of womanhood—and they
were both happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime a shadow was darkening the sky of
England—a storm-cloud, destined to shake from its
foundation her political fabric, and place another
Stuart on the throne. Cromwell, the Protector—the
hero of the seventeenth century, was summoned to
repose! Bravely had he borne his armor on the
great battle-ground of life, and his valiant heart had
not fainted in the heat of the conflict. The humble
plebian had dared boldly to take up arms against his
country’s foes in defiance of his king; and subsequently,
at the same country’s call, and in defense
of her liberties, with the Book of God in his hand,
and a psalm on his lips, to affix his signature to the
death-warrant of the sovereign traitor. Ever, where
duty called, was he found foremost in the ranks of
the faithful, battling for the right; and when in the
maturity of manhood the sun of glory brightened his
gray hairs with the splendor of royalty, he turned
coldly away from the crown of a king, preferring the
simple title of Protector of the Commonwealth. His
sword was still girded against the Lord’s enemies,
when a voice from above summoned him from
earthly glory to heavenly rest; and on the third of
September, one thousand six hundred and fifty-eight,
Oliver Cromwell stood girded for his last conflict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Historians have recorded <span class='it'>that</span> as a fearful night
when the Lord Protector lay struggling with the
final enemy. Wildly wailed the wind around that
earthly palace; but the eye of the dying was on the
eternal mansion, and so amid the fury of the elements,
the great spirit of Cromwell achieved its
final victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A loud wail burst from the whole army of Puritans,
for well they knew there was none powerful
like him to cope with their adversaries. The
master-spirits among their opponents would not reverence
his son, because the father had held them
in check; and the inefficient Richard Cromwell had
nothing to claim for himself. He beheld the country
rent by faction, and having no power to quell insubordination,
and, moreover, fearing the result to
himself, he quietly resigned his Protectorate, and
all that had been gained to England by Cromwell’s
life, was lost in his death. Whither would now flee
the fifty-nine judges who had decreed Charles Stuart
to the scaffold, or where the friends of the Protector
find safety?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not far from the shores of a sunny lake in the
depths of the American forest stood the rude log-hut
of an emigrant. The site was one of surpassing
loveliness—for nature here, in her unbounded domain,
had done the work of ages, and the majestic
oak towered in silent grandeur beside the graceful
elm and the drooping willow, making mockery of
art. Birds of glittering plumage sang all day in this
wildwood retreat—for, save this one log-cottage, for
miles and miles around was no human habitation.
The slight clearing, scarcely sufficient for a garden-patch,
sloping down to the water-side, told of no
hardy adventurer hunting fortune in the wilderness
of the new world; and it would have puzzled even
a Yankee of this present age to have <span class='it'>guessed</span> at the
pursuit or object of the tenants of that forest home,
so contradictory seemed they in outward aspect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The family consisted of but four members—a tall,
noble-looking man, a little past the meridian of life,
with piercing eyes, and dark locks sprinkled with
white, falling rather thinly over his broad forehead.
His dress was of the plainest, coarsest drab cloth;
indeed, there was nothing to distinguish it from that
of the negro servant who attended him, except the
natural grace and dignity imparted by the manly
form of the wearer. The other two occupants of
this secluded abode were a young girl, who might
have numbered seventeen summers, and an elderly female,
who had once been her nurse, but who was now
a sort of housekeeper in general, inasmuch as there
was none other to superintend the domestic arrangements;
but had you taken a peep into the interior of
the cottage, you would have seen no lack of comfort,
and even some faint show of taste, considering the
dearth of material. A coarse carpet was thrown over
the rough log-door, and ranged around the sides of the
apartment were rustic seats composed of branches
of trees, covered, sofa-like, with skins of animals,
forming comfortable couches for sitting or reclining.
Indian blankets, tastefully embroidered, served as a
partition between this and a small room adjoining,
which was fitted up for the young lady’s boudoir,
and which was occupied in common by both females.
Here, on a table of oak, covered with kid-skin, lay a
few books, and a guitar, evidently the relics of other
days. A large sea-shell served for a vase, and stood
on the rude table, filled with wood-flowers, the first
gift of summer. Perhaps, too, you might have
noticed some large, massive chests in either apartment,
and wondered how such ponderous articles
had found place in so small a habitation; but we
have a key to the mystery, reader, and will give it
thee, together with the secret of this secluded family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some eighteen months prior to the time our
chapter commences, a gentlemanly-looking resident
of the new Quaker city, calling himself, John
Brown, saw every where posted up, by order of the
new king, directions for the seizure and arrest of all
persons known or supposed to be implicated in the
fate of Charles Stuart—with large rewards held out
as an incentive, to those who should successfully aid
the king’s officers in their search.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an hour of darkness to many a poor fugitive,
for disguises were no longer to be trusted, and life’s
last hope lay in strict concealment in rocks or forests,
or amid the haunts of the savages. Every tie of kindred
was now to be sundered—every communication
with the world of mankind to be cut off, and the
wanderer was henceforward to live with all the
golden threads of being rudely snapped by a tyrant.
There was no time to be lost, for “blood for blood”
was the royal watchword, and his legions were on
the track.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brown was fully alive to his danger, but with the
cool, undaunted heart of a man accustomed to war
with obstacles, he sat down calmly to meditate the
best course of procedure. To remain a day longer
in the city he knew full well was madness, and every
hour was fraught with danger. Could he leave
here in a land of strangers, alone and unprotected
save by one frail woman, the delicate blossom he had
cherished as “Love’s lost token,” and borne over
the waters to cheer his declining age? How could
he talk of a separation of years, perhaps forever, from
the gentle creature, whose life was all centered in his—how
could she bear this last stroke also? True, he
had wealth—treasures of gold and silver; wealth
would purchase friends, but dangerous friends, too,
he thought, for a lonely orphan girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat deep in thought for a moment longer, then
reached his hand and touched a silver bell, exclaiming—“It
shall be as <span class='it'>she</span> wishes. I will abide <span class='it'>her</span>
choice at all events!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ring was speedily answered by a good-looking
man-servant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I here, Massa Brown,” said the ebony, making
a full display of ivory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Miss Anna in, Carle?” inquired the master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do no! rudder tink she be, Massa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go then, and tell her I would see her. Be quick,
Carle, and do you wait until I call, for I shall want
you again soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment after, a fairy-like creature bounded
into the presence of her father, and winding her arms
caressingly around his neck, waited his pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are ill, dear father,” said she at length, observing
his pale forehead. “I have wasted all the morning
on my pet birds, thinking you were out as usual.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed her cheek fondly, and replied—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did go out, my child, but quickly returned, for
there is danger abroad, and there is no more rest for
thy father. ’Tis a mournful summons for thee, darling,
but there is no time to be lost in revealing the true
cause of it. I must flee speedily, or the new king’s
officers will soon bear me back to drop my head at
Whitehall. Bear it bravely, Anna, you are my
own daughter, and know well the happy days
of the Protectorate are ended. There is gold, more
than sufficient for all thy wants!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, father, <span class='it'>you</span> are <span class='it'>my wealth</span>; all the treasure
of this world to me! Whither would you flee, and
wherefore leave me behind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not, daughter—some secret hiding-place
where the hand of a Stuart may not reach me, far
from the abodes of civilized life. Every thing is to
be encountered—want in its worst forms, and you,
who have been nurtured in a palace, could poorly
cope with cold and hunger! Stay here, my child,
amid ease and plenty, and let thy father go forth to
meet his fate alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, father, Anna Temple is not the weak child
you suppose, if you can urge her to forsake her gray-haired
parent, because, perchance she must leave behind
the downy pillow on which she was cradled!
There is no privation in going which I cannot readily
undergo, and who knows, father, but we may make
us a new home in the wilderness. At all events,
wherever thou goest I will go, and thy lot shall be
mine for ever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The noble Lord Temple—for the self-styled John
Brown was no other than the friend and ally of Cromwell,
clasped his child to his heart, and said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If this be your wish, Anna, I will see what can
be effected in a few brief hours. Carle must be summoned
immediately, and you may proceed to put in
as small compass as possible your own treasures and
your mother’s relics, and provide yourself with plain
Quaker apparel, for such must be our disguise. Judy,
your old nurse must be let into the secret without
loss of time, and I will inform Carle; the other servants
must be kept in the dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anna departed with alacrity to obey the directions
of her father, for in her breast the fount of life still
sparkled with the delightful romance of youth;
while her sire, who had seen bubble after bubble rise
and break upon its surface, proceeded with emotions
entirely different to unfold to the faithful Carle the
plan of procedure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trusty negro was directed to go and purchase a
number of suits of Quaker clothing for his master,
with the broad-brim hat, to render the disguise as
complete as possible, while he, himself made haste
to fill the large chests they had brought over sea with
treasure, and whatever they would be most likely to
need in their unknown resting-place; and in less than
three hours every thing had been prepared for their
departure. John Brown, with his felt-hat and wide
lappel made a pattern Quaker, and Anna looked rogueishly
out from beneath her straight bonnet—then
arose the question when, and how they should depart.
After some consultation, it was agreed they
should wait until nightfall; when master and the ladies
should set forward on foot, and walk on as fast
as possible, and Carle should put the carriage-horses
into an emigrant’s waggon, with boxes, chests, etc.,
not forgetting a supply of axes and fire-arms, and
meet them at a spot designated a few miles from the
city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There remained but one more apparent difficulty;
the other servants of the household must be informed
of their sudden purpose, as all efforts to conceal their
departure would be ineffectual, and the truth could
not be confided to them with safety. The disguises
were again thrown aside, the servants all summoned,
and Lord Temple addressed them, thus—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have received an unexpected summons from
the new king, and must depart immediately. I shall
take but Carle with the young mistress and her
nurse, and leave the rest of you in charge of the house
until our return; but should any thing occur to prevent
my coming back in the spring, you are one and all
entitled to your freedom. Until then you will be
faithful to the interest of your master!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, massa. Lord bless good Massa Brown and
young missey, too!” chimed in half-a-dozen voices
at once; for the refugee had maintained an independent
household, and lived as became a man of wealth
and fashion. He had left England immediately after
the death of Cromwell, foreseeing the probable issue
of the Protectorate; and wishing to spend the residue
of his days in peace, he dropped at once his name
and title, and was known only in the young city as a
private gentleman of good fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, when all was hushed in the good
“City of Brotherly Love,” Lord Temple, with his
daughter and nurse Judy, stole softly from their new
and pleasant home, to seek some sheltering asylum
from the merciless hand of persecution. They
walked on in silence until they gained the outskirts
of the city, the young and delicate Anna clinging to
both her father and nurse; for the deep silence of the
night filled her heart with strange fancies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your strength is not sufficient for your purpose,
Anna,” said her father, noticing how nervously she
clung to him. “The way will be long and solitary
for a tender child like you! Will not my daughter
return now to a home, that will afford her still a
shelter at least?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And would not the way seem longer and darker
to my father, if his only child were behind him?
Think not because I tremble a little now at first that
my heart is weak and cowardly. I have never before
walked in the street at midnight, you know,
and every rustle seems a king’s officer to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless you, my darling,” exclaimed her father.
“The blood of the Temple’s is in your veins, warm
and noble; I cannot bear to see it chilled by misfortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no regrets for the world we are leaving
behind save on your account, my dearest father; on
the contrary, I feel it will be charming to dwell
alone in the great forest of the West, where the fetters
of fashion, pride and ambition will cease to enthral,
and we may learn of the great Creator by the
infinity of his works, instead of the multitude of
man’s words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus did the brave girl attempt to cheer the desponding
spirits of her father as they moved forward
amid the darkness of their solitary way. They
directed their course northward, and although they
were in the main road, the “woods of centuries”
were all around them, and their giant shadows
seemed like some spectral army gathered in the
gloom of night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning dawned on the little band nearly
ten miles from the city, and although they had two
or three times paused for a little rest by the wayside,
it found them weak and weary; but the spot where
they were to turn aside and wait for their wagon
and refreshments was near, and they pressed forward.
Their stopping-place was a few hundred
yards from the road-side—a beautiful spot, by a
spring of fresh water, where hunting parties often
stopped to regale themselves with a dinner of game,
or at least, to quaff a drink of water from the spring.
Carle had often been there, and had described the
spot so minutely it could not be mistaken; and when
at length they seated themselves, and Judy took
from her pocket some cakes, which, woman-like,
she had been provident enough to bring along with
her, their drooping spirits revived, and they ate the
morsel cheerfully and drank from the spring, for
they were faint as well as weary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a bright morning of early autumn! The
breath of summer yet lingered in the air, though the
mists were on the hill-tops, and the forest was
tinged with the faintest hue of red—the first presage
of decay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, father, is it not magnificent!” exclaimed
Anna Temple, as she pointed to the boundless woods
rising like an ampitheatre on either hand! “This
is like what I have read of the new world, only
more sublime if possible. Positively there is more
of grandeur in this one scene than in all the courts
of royalty in the world. Why, just see—the Eastern
kings have never worn mantles more elegantly
tinged with scarlet and gold, than these old patriarch
trees have put on. It really makes our Quaker
garb look sombre, and I expect the very birds will
be <span class='it'>theeing</span> and <span class='it'>thouing</span> us as we pass on through
their territory.” And the happy-hearted creature
clapped her hands and laughed until the hills sent
back an echo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, hush, daughter; there is the rumbling of
wheels near—nearer than the main road, too, I fear!
It may be some party of hunters who have made
this a place of rendezvous; it cannot be that foes are
thus early on the track, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the mention of foes the cheek of Anna was
pale as clay, and she nestled close beside her father;
but a moment afterward she started to her feet, and
the red blood again mantled her brow as she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis Carle, I really think—’tis only Carle, father!
I know by the snap of his whip, for no other
person ever snapped one like him. Why, Judy, he
thinks it time you are making coffee, and has whipped
up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was indeed Carle, who came thus unexpectedly
upon them, two hours at least sooner than looked
for by his master, who had recommended him to
stay behind until they had got a fair start, lest some
suspicious eye should detect them, and the whole
plan be frustrated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He! he! he! You got here fust, anyhow,” said
the darkey, as he brought his horses to a stand beside
them; “though I tried hard to catch up and
give young missy a ride. Guess we had better eat
breakfast in a hurry and be off, for some of dem
nigger ask a great many question last night ’specting
de big boxes we load in. But I guess I set ’em on
de wrong track, any how. He! he! he!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flint was produced and fire struck, and shortly
after the air was fragrant with boiling coffee,
and a very comfortable breakfast was eaten on the
green grass by the spring side; after which, things
were quickly put in place, and the little company
took the seats arranged for them in the broad, emigrant’s
wagon, and sped on as ignorant of their destination
as the ancient patriarch journeying on to the
“Land of Promise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For five long, tedious days they went forward as
fast as the miserable state of the roads and the jaded
condition of the horses would allow, stopping occasionally
to refresh themselves by some pleasant
stream that crossed their path in the wilderness.
They occasionally fell in with some person who
questioned them of their journey, and their reply
was invariably, “Going north to settle;” but one
<span class='it'>real Quaker</span> was not thus contented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thee lookest tired friend, wilt thou partake of a
brother’s hospitality on thy way? Nay, no refusal,
the young woman looketh sick and needeth a night’s
rest! Rachel will give her nursing right gladly,
for no Friends have crossed our threshold for
months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the third day of their flight, and worn down
with fatigue and loss of rest, they could not resist
this pressing appeal of the good brother, and accordingly
the horses were allowed to stop in front
of a large log farm-house on the banks of the Susquehanna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the <span class='it'>soi disant</span> John Brown had some trouble
in sustaining the new character he had assumed, for
he not only made laughable blunders in the Quaker
dialect, but when questioned of the prosperity and
welfare of his brethren in the good city, betrayed an
ignorance certainly unwarrantable in a brother; but
his host was a shrewd, sensible man, and soon
guessed more of his guest’s secret than would have
rendered his stay comfortable had he surmised it.
But the secret was in safe keeping, and the poor
fugitives were loaded with kindness and sent forward
on the morrow with the nicest provisions of
the dairy for their future necessity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beware of New England Friends,” said their
hospitable host, with a sly look, at parting, “or the
<span class='it'>good Puritans</span> there may send thee back <span class='it'>with holes
in thy tongue</span>, or <span class='it'>minus ears</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last two days of their journey were beset
with difficulties and dangers. They had forsaken
the public way, and their path was literally in the
wilderness, and so thickly strewn with obstacles as
to render every step tedious and toilsome; but death
was behind, and the hope of life before, and so they
went forward steadily and patiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the close of the fifth day they came suddenly
into a beautiful valley, sheltered on all sides by bold
hills, and encircling in its bosom a clear, quiet lake.
Not a vestige of human kind was discernible in this
spot, so charming that it seemed fresh from the hand
of its Creator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is not this such a spot as we have been seeking,
father?” inquired Anna, with a pleading look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, daughter, if there is peace and safety on
earth it must be in this Eden of the forest. Here
we will fix our dwelling-place, in the midst of this
romantic scenery. To-morrow, Carle, we must set
to work to prepare a habitation; you are something
of a carpenter I think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, yes, massa; me learn de trade in good old
England, but not wid such big log as dis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have now traced the flight of the illustrious
but unfortunate Judge Temple from the Quaker
city—his first resting-place in the Western world—to
the forest home introduced to our reader at the
commencement of the chapter. More than a year
and a half had passed since the wanderers had sought
refuge in the friendly wild, whose shelter had afforded
a safe retreat from friend or foe; for no white
face had smiled or frowned on them in their new
habitation. They had lived alone! The forest and
lake supplied them with food, and they had a little
garden which furnished them with vegetables,
having brought with them a variety of seed and
utensils for the culture of the soil. They had a few
books, and Anna and her father read together, to
while away the long hours of winter; but in summer
they dragged not heavily; for there was life and
beauty around them, and in the warm breast of
Anna Temple was a perpetual fountain of sunlight.
To her father she seemed as happy as the birds that
warbled all day in gladness—and she was truly
happy—happy in herself, in her only parent, and in
every thing bright and beautiful around her; still
her thoughts in their loneliness often reverted to her
<span class='it'>first home</span>, and the blessed hours of her childhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But not for lost splendor did she dwell thus fondly
the memory of the past, it was for the lost companions
of those rainbow-tinted years, whose fate
she might never know. Scattered far and wide
over the earth she knew them to be, but who
among them had fallen victims, she vainly strove to
conjecture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And one among those whose images were linked
with her dreams, was the dark-haired Vaudois student,
who had taught her the Alpine shepherd songs
which she still loved to play at nightfall, as she
watched the stars peering out, with their angel-eyes,
and she would sometimes weep as she thought
that pale-browed youth might even then be wearing
the golden crown he had so early sought to
win.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It surely was a solitary life for an ardent young
creature like Anna Temple to dwell thus apart from
the world, shut out from every association of her
earlier and happier years; still she was never for a
moment discontented with her lot. A nest of young
birds she fed and tamed, and every wild-flower of
rare beauty was transplanted in her garden-plot—so
her loving heart had food for its impassioned yearnings.
One human creature, too, had found a place
in her affections even here in the wilderness. The
summer after their arrival, a party of Indians from
a neighboring tribe had sought, as was their custom,
the shores of this sunny lake to fish. Among them
came the chief, with his only daughter, nearly the
same age as Anna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Weetano was a most superb creature; graceful
as a fawn, with eyes clear and dark as a gazelle’s,
and she burst upon them like a glorious vision—so
unlike any thing they had seen, or even fancied.
Her father, the old chief, seemed not at first well
pleased to find his summer retreat invaded by a pale
face, but Lord Temple’s courteous address soon
won his favor, and he came with confidence to the
cottage, where he was entertained with so many
presents and novelties, that he went and brought his
daughter to see the “white squaw,” as he called
Anna, and hear her sing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anna took her guitar and sang with it to the infinite
delight of her visitors, who asked her if the
creature were alive, for they had learned a little
English from the fur-traders. She then displayed to
the Indian maiden her treasures, and presented her
with a beautiful coral necklace, that had pleased her
fancy better than any thing else. The chief looked
highly gratified to see Anna clasp the trinket round
his daughter’s neck, and he inquired with some
pride—“Will the Pale-Lily sail in the canoe with
Red-Bird?” for thus he called his daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anna was delighted with the novelty of the proposition,
and hastened to accompany her new companion
to the lake-side, leaving the old chief with
her father at the cottage. She had never before
seen a canoe like Weetano’s, it was befitting a
chief’s daughter, or a princess royal, with its snowy
mat of swan’s-down, and decorated with the quills
of the porcupine and feathers of every hue. The
Indian girl seized the paddles, and jumping into the
fairy-looking bark motioned Anna to a seat on the
mat opposite, but with all the romance and enthusiasm
of her nature, she hesitated; for the thing
seemed all too frail for the burden of a human
weight on the dark waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does the white girl fear?” inquired Weetano, in
most musical accents. “Look how Red-Bird can
guide a canoe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And quick as thought she dipped the oars, and the
boat darted away like a bird on the wing. Round
and round she went in swift circles, and a more picturesque
looking creature could not be imagined
than the beautiful forest-girl in the wild costume of
her tribe. Her richly beaded robe, clasped on the
right shoulder, fell gracefully over a form of the
most perfect mould, and was confined around the
left knee, leaving the arms and limbs entirely bare;
while her long, raven hair floated wildly over her
neck; but encircling her head was a fillet of beads,
into which were woven feathers of the white-hawk—the
insignia of their tribe. Anna gazed with delight
and astonishment on the glorious creature in
her fantastic bark skimming the blue lake with a
motion as light and graceful as we image a
fairy’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indian girl soon rowed to the shore again,
and Anna now seated herself on the soft mat beside
Weetano with delight, and away they went—the
high-born daughter of Europe and the red forest-maiden
in happy companionship; and though differing
widely in outward mien, each wore the seal of
beauty and the air of nobility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that day there was an ardent attachment
between Anna Temple and the chief’s daughter.
Every day found the little canoe moored at the point
of the lake nearest the cottage, and many a bright
summer hour was passed by them roaming the
woods, or sailing the fairy boat, before the chief and
his party were ready to depart. It was with real
sorrow that Anna heard she was to lose her new
companion, but Weetano told her they would come
again the next summer, and Pale-Lily should have
a canoe like hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oliwibatuc was the chief of the Mohawks, and
his principal village was about thirty miles from
the north shore of the lake. He was a powerful
chieftain, and held a stern body of warriors and
braves ready to do his bidding. His wigwam was
hung with the trophies of his own deeds and daring.
He was now going back to sound the war-cry and
seek revenge for the real or fancied injury done his
tribe by the French traders on the Canadian frontier.
It was a dark passion and bloody would be its
fruits, but surely one less reprehensible in an unenlightened
savage than in those who wear the garments
of Christianity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second winter passed more fleetly with our
fugitives than the first, and at the time our chapter
commenced they had gathered around them many
conveniences and comforts in their forest home. As
the season advanced, Anna began to watch with impatience
for their summer visitors, for she longed
for something to disturb the monotony of her life,
and Red-Bird’s visit would be sure to bring with it
new amusements and pleasures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning she descried a speck on the distant
water, and exclaimed with delight—“A canoe, father—it
must be a canoe! There is a speck on the
lake; now another, and another—it must be the party
of Oliwibatuc with darling Red-Bird! O, I am so
happy! Hasten, and go with me, father, to the
shore to meet and welcome them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was indeed the party of the Mohawk chief, who
had come this season to encamp on the south shore
of the lake at a little distance from the emigrant’s
cottage. Their number was much greater than on
the summer preceding, and their dress and appearance
far more imposing. Every warrior wore the
tuft of hawk’s-feathers, and a gay wampum-belt,
and Oliwibatuc was borne down almost with his
symbolic decorations, among which the claws of the
eagle were most conspicuous. They had come back
from their last campaign victorious, and the savage
and Christian victor must alike wear the regalia in
the hour of triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Weetano had been true to her promise, and
brought the Pale-Lily a little canoe, the very counterpart
of her own, and after she had gained a little
experience in rowing side by side, they glided over
the smooth waters gathering white lilies in the shallows
to wreathe in their hair, or starting up the
wild birds that often lay in multitudes on the bosom
of the lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Anna was not long in discovering that a change
was on her young companion. Weetano was not
now the glad, sunny-hearted creature she had known
in the year gone by. Her wild, musical laugh no
longer awoke the mountain echo, and her step had
lost its fleetness—for, the delicate white girl could
now outstrip the forest-maiden who so lately outstripped
the deer. She would sometimes sit silent
and motionless in her canoe, gazing down into the
deep waters with an intensity that both surprised
and alarmed her companion, and once, when questioned
by her, she replied—“She was listening for
whisperings of the Great Spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will the Lily teach Weetano to read the Great
Book of the white man?” inquired the Indian girl one
morning, as they were sitting alone in Anna’s little
room. “She has a new brother in her father’s
lodge; he is a Book man, and will not take up the
bow and tomahawk! He sings the songs of the
spirit-land, but no war-song; and when Weetano was
sick and dying, he pointed her to the blue home of
the weary! Weetano has looked on the face of her
pale brother, and the image of her Brave has faded
from her heart! The Huron’s spirit no longer
comes to me in dreams! Owanaw should take a
warrior maiden to his wigwam, and leave the
daughter of the Mohawk to dwell in peace! Teach
me the Book then, but tell it not to Oliwibatuc.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been already stated that the Mohawk chief
and his party had returned from their last campaign
victorious. The hair of many a scalp was braided
with serpent-skins around their necks, and twelve
young captives had been brought home to suffer in
the presence of the whole tribe. As they drew near
their principal city, the captors sent up a savage yell,
and prolonged it until the hills sent back the sound;
but the aged warriors and the braves who remained
at home echoed it not. Wherefore came they not
forth as was their custom, to greet their triumphant
brethren? The silence boded no good, and Oliwibatuc
led on his band with a sullen, down-cast eye.
He approached his lodge with the prisoners and their
guard, and entered it in silence; but within, all was
noise and distraction. Hideous outcries, mingled with
strange incantations saluted his ears, and there on a
low couch lay the prostrate form of the chief’s daughter.
The low moaning of the poor maiden was a sad
welcome for the old warrior, for Weetano had been
the song-bird of his lodge, and the sunlight of her
face had once been the sunlight of her mother’s. He
stood by her couch with stern composure, and thrice
uttered “Weetano,” but the ear of his daughter was
dull to the voice of affection, and the haughty warrior
uttered a deep groan, and bowed his head, for his
pride was low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was one among the prisoners of Oliwibatuc
who looked not unmoved on the mournful spectacle—one,
whose faith taught “Love to enemies,” and
whose mission on earth was that of his Master—<span class='it'>to
do good</span>. It was a youthful “soldier of the Cross,”
that stood a captive in the lodge of the Mohawk
chief. Torture and death he was expecting soon to
receive from the hands of his merciless captors, but
the light of his faith was clear and bright, and his
last deed should be one of mercy. He saw that the
disease had formed a crisis, and the poor sufferer
seemed rapidly sinking with exhaustion; but there
was still life, and a shadow of hope, and he approached
the stricken chief, and laying his hand gently
on his arm, said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Great Spirit has given the Pale Face the art
of healing; if it be not too late, I will restore thy
daughter; but the tumult must first be hushed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was gratitude in the old chief’s eye: for a
tone of sympathy falls never unheeded, no matter
how barren the heart; and with a motion of his
hand the savage din was hushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, save her, and ye shall live, young Pale
Face!” murmured the chief. “She is my only
child—the last of the eagle’s nest! Save her, and
ye shall be as Olo, the son of Oliwibatuc, who fell
by the great Lakes in battle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captive knew that a flask of brandy was in
possession of one of the prisoners. The Indians had
not then learned its use, though something of its abuse
they had found out in their intercourse with the traders.
He obtained this immediately, and diluting a
little with water, put it to the lips of the poor girl,
who lay unconscious of all around her. She swallowed
with great difficulty, and he perceived an unearthly
chill in the perspiration that damped her forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blankets and fire, chief,” said the young man,
with a trembling voice. “Soon, or it will be too
late! Set these prisoners to work,” added he, on
looking round and perceiving the lodge deserted save
by the chief and his captives. “Hot blankets must
be had immediately!” And he set himself to work,
chafing the cold hands of the poor moaning sufferer,
with an activity that manifested the earnestness of
his purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oliwibatuc went to the door of his wigwam, and
sent up a cry, that immediately brought a dozen of
his tribe at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire and hot blankets must be had instantly,” said
he, in the tone of one accustomed to command.
“Where is the old woman, Zohah? Summon her
again—the maiden must not die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His directions were promptly obeyed. But the red
men looked sullen and displeased to see the young
captive employed in the service of their chief. The
old Indian nurse-woman, too, had come again, and
seeing the preparations, she muttered—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No good! No good! Bad Spirit will not submit,
and Good Spirit has forsaken Weetano! Zohah
has used all healing herbs, but—bad, bad. Zohah’s
arts cannot hush the voice from the far south-west!
The maiden has heard the call! She will die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps, not, mother,” said the young physician,
soothingly. “The Great Spirit can hush the
voice. Will you not lend your aid, that the daughter
of your chief may live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus addressed, old Zohah seemed pleased to follow
his directions, and after the patient had been
carefully wrapped in the heated blankets, and a few
more drops of the brandy put into her mouth, they
sat down to watch for its effects, on the unconscious
girl. Long, long seemed the moments of that weary
watch, and yet the anxious prisoner could discern no
change. He took her hand in his, and counted the
feeble pulsations—it was still chill and cold, yet his
heart encouraged him on in his ministry of mercy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some herbs, good Zohah. Put some herbs on
her feet—the long dock-leaves will do, if bruised
and withered. She must have some more of the liquid,
too,” and for the third time the red beverage
was put to her lips. She now swallowed with less
difficulty, and her breath was not so hurried and
faint; still there was no sign of consciousness, and
her attendant relapsed again to his watch, still retaining
the wrist of the sufferer in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old chief stood a little apart, gazing with an
eagle-eye on every movement, but not a word had
escaped his lips since his first orders had been obeyed,
and he betrayed no sign of weariness, though he
had not been seated since his long march.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour afterward, the low moaning had died
away, and the voice of the captive youth whispered
in the ears of Oliwibatuc—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>She sleeps: thy daughter sleeps!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seven suns have set, and this is the maiden’s
first quiet sleep,” said old Zohah. “The Pale Face
brings witch-water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, nay, mother, thy good herbs and gentle
nursing have aided the sufferer; but we must still
watch, for on this slumber perhaps, depends her
life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old chief approached his captive, and said in
grateful accents—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thy life is not sufficient; what boon wilt thou
ask at the hand of the Mohawk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That thou wilt send my fellow-captives back to
their country, chief; and I will still be thy prisoner.
They have homes there. I have neither country
nor home. I will stay and watch the recovery of
thy daughter, but let my brethren go without torture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a great request for an Indian to give up his
prisoners, and for a moment he seemed wavering—then
he added—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is more than leagues of wampun—but it shall
be done. To-morrow, they shall go, and thou shalt
stay in the lodge of Oliwibatuc—not my prisoner, but
my son, instead of Olo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All was silence again in that forest wigwam, and
the youthful captive held on his watch. Old Zohah
was snoring loudly on one hand, and the old chief had
at last spread his blanket, and laid down to rest after
his weary march. The youth was alone. The deep
shadows of the night hung a solitude over the wilderness,
and as he sat there in the rude wigwam of the
savage, his thoughts took backward wing: he was a
child again, climbing the mountain-path with the
flocks—gathering wild grapes in the valleys, and
returning to a happy cottage-home at evening.
Then a soft footstep was in his ear, and a gentle tone—<span class='it'>they
were his mother’s</span>! A little hand was nestled
in his, as his sire took the Book of God and read the
words of wisdom from its holy pages; then came
back to his weary heart those home-voices mingling
in the evening psalm, and his face brightened—but
memory was soon too faithful to the reality, and a
tear rolled down his cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A new leaf was turned in his life-book! He was
a youth in a foreign land: strange objects were
around him—the tones of strangers in his ears. The
cottage of the Alps had been exchanged for a home
in a kingly palace. Men of learning and science had
there been his teachers, and his ardent heart had loved
and treasured up the words of wisdom. Gentle forms
had floated around him, and the image of <span class='it'>one</span> sweet,
youthful face, was yet a dew-drop on his spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another leaf—and he was again a wanderer!
Another cloud had burst in storm over his head, and
a wide ocean spread its stormy waves betwixt him
and the land of his birth. He had come a fugitive over
its waters, bearing the gospel seed, which he hoped ere
long to see springing up in the boundless field of the
west; but a twelvemonth had scarcely passed, ere a
merciless war-party had numbered him with its victims.
Persecution and torture had no power to make
his youthful spirit quail, for men of iron purpose had
moulded him for a martyr to his creed, and as he sat
there that night in his lonely watch, he looked upward
to his home above, with a clear unshaken confidence,
and forward into the dim, uncertain future
without a fear. He had been the happy instrument of
saving a number of his fellow-beings from torturing
death, and on the morrow they would be restored to
home and freedom. He had no home—had left behind
him no kindred, and here, perchance, was the
vineyard which his Master had given him to plant
with the “Living Vine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the thoughts that rapidly winged their
way through the mind of the young captive as he sat
listening to the now low, soft breathing of the Indian
maiden, and his heart was happy in the consciousness
of its right and holy purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a low murmur—he turned his head
and the dark eye of the chief’s daughter was fixed
upon him with a look of conscious scrutiny, but in a
moment the lids were heavy again with slumber.
He went cautiously to Zohah and awoke her, lest the
maiden might fear finding herself with a stranger.
Old Zohah took the cup, and bending over the couch
said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Weetano thirsty? Here is drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She opened her eyes again, and said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it you, good Zohah? I dreamed a Pale Face
was beside me. Has my father yet returned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He sleeps weary with the war-chase. He spoke
to Weetano, but she answered not. Will the maiden
see her father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, let him rest until morning. The warrior is
aged, and comes to his lodge weary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the old chief was awake to the first tone of
his daughter’s voice, and he bent over her couch caressingly,
saying—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Red-Bird is better now; she has a new brother,
and he has saved her life! He must slumber now,
for the march was long! He shall eat, hereafter, at
the board of Oliwibatuc.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captive came forward again, and gave some
directions to Zohah for the remainder of the night,
and then gladly lay down as the chief desired, for the
danger was past, and he was sorely fatigued. Sweet
were his first slumbers in the lodge of the Mohawk
chief, and his dreams like the waking vision, were
of the Alps; for as the reader has already imagined,
the stranger was no other than Francois Waldo—the
Vaudois peasant-boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the summer wore on, the change in Weetano
grew more and more apparent to the watchful eye
of Anna Temple, and awoke in her loving heart an
earnest anxiety for her safety. Her strength was
no longer sufficient to urge forward her canoe—and
it rested like a bird on the water; and though she
still insisted on the daily ramble in the greenwood,
she followed her companion with faltering footsteps,
and each day their resting-place was some fallen
trunk or mossy rock nearer home than on the day
preceding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was during these summer rambles that Anna
had acceded to the earnest entreaty of her friend to
instruct her in the “Book of the Pale Face;” and
the avidity with which she gathered the words of
instruction betrayed an ardent thirst for wisdom.
She was soon able to read with a little assistance,
and Anna presented her with a little Pocket-Bible,
that had been the companion of all her wanderings,
with her own name in gilt on the cover. It was
her sole copy of the Scriptures—but the family
Bible lay on the shelf, at their cottage; and she
wisely thought her little volume would be of greater
worth to Red-Bird than to herself—and much cause
had she afterward for joy that her gift of love was
thus bestowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the season advanced, Weetano manifested an
anxiety with regard to their return, and evidently
dreaded her father’s orders to depart—for she had
learned a little of the tastes and habits of her white
friends, and they seemed more congenial to her now
delicate frame than the ruder customs of her tribe.
There seemed, moreover, some secret care weighing
down her spirits; and although she, Indian-like,
buried it for a time in her own bosom, and Anna
forbore questioning, it at length found voice in
words. They were sitting by the lake-side one
morning, and Anna plucked a pretty blue flower
just opening there, and gave it to Red-Bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis the first herald of autumn,” said Weetano.
“The gentian opens for the corn-dance, and Oliwibatuc
will soon go to his tribe. Would that Red-Bird
might stay in the lodge with Pale-Lily until
the feast of the braves is over! She cannot dress
the lodge of the chief—Weetano is weary;” and
the Indian girl burst into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are sick, darling Red-Bird,” said Anna,
taking her hand in a caressing manner. “Tell me
what is the matter, and I will nurse you, for you
are all the sister I have here in this distant home.
You are not afraid to trust <span class='it'>me</span>, Weetano?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! Weetano love the pale face! Listen, she
will whisper all! Next moon the Mohawk chief
will spread the corn-feast, and the Huron warriors
will come with their braves to smoke the pipe with
our tribe, and bury the bloody tomahawk! ’Tis a
hundred moons since our fathers took it up, but the
young chief of the Hurons sent presents to the Mohawk’s
wigwam, and comes to seek his daughter;
Oliwibatuc has sent back the belt of friendship, and
Weetano must go to the lodge of Owanaw, to make
sure the bonds of the warriors. She had sooner die,
for the shadow of her pale brother will go with her
to the land of spirits; but it will not follow her to a
warrior’s wigwam—for he loves not the bow and
tomahawk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your father will not force you to go, Weetano;
why do you speak so mournfully?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His word was pledged more than twenty moons
ago. A warrior breaks not his word! Weetano was
a gay child then, and loved the feast and the dance
of the braves. But she has learned another life
now—her new brother has awakened it, and she
reads it in Pale-Lily’s book; but Oliwibatuc will
shut his ears and be angry, and Weetano must
go. She is the last of his race, and must wed a
warrior.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a mournful look of despair depicted on
the countenance of the Indian maiden as she uttered
these last words, that went to the heart of Anna—and
she sought to divert her from the unwelcome
theme, by telling her stories of her first home over
the blue waters. After exhausting many a topic,
she told her of the beautiful peasant-boy who had
been her companion for years, and the story of his
persecuted people, and of his little sister, whose fate
he had so often bewailed in her childish ears. She
then told her she would sing her a song he had
learnt her of his own wild hills; but before she
had proceeded far, Weetano stopped her with an
exclamation of delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My pale brother sings the Lily’s song at the
silence of nightfall in the lodge of Oliwibatuc! He,
too, came over the great waters, but he speaks the
words of the French.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden thought flashed through the mind of
Anna, flushing her cheek with crimson at first, and
then leaving it paler than before. “Could it be
possible!” she thought; “but no, the idea was preposterous!
The Canadians were all French—many
of them would, doubtless, sing the songs of their
own mountain peasantry!” The object of her young
imaginings had probably gone back to his native
valley, if, indeed, he had escaped the hands of the
new Stuart: and so the thought was dismissed with
a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Weetano was right in her conjecture that Oliwibatuc
would soon return to his tribe, as his directions
next morning proved; but the old chief read
plainly in his daughter’s countenance a reluctance
to comply, which he attributed to the parting from
her white friend. “Red-Bird is the daughter of
warriors;” said the old chief, reprovingly! “Doth
she carry a faint heart in her breast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she replied; “but Weetano is weary, and
her way is in the mist! She can no longer lay the
couch for the warriors, or spread the cup for the
braves! Let her stay until the feast is over, for she
hears the voice of spirits, and is no longer a mate for
the young eagle of the Hurons!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was stern pride in the look of the chief,
but he only replied, “The maiden will go to her
lodge with Oliwibatuc! The Pale-Lily will come
thither to the corn-feast with her father!” No other
word was spoken—and the chief, with his party,
went his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Temple and his daughter were both highly
pleased with the Mohawk’s invitation to be present
at the corn-dance, and witness the meeting of tribes
long hostile, at the feast of peace. Oliwibatuc had
promised to send a convoy of braves to conduct
them thither, but the anticipated pleasure could not
remove from Anna’s mind the mournful tone of
Red-Bird, and the words still haunted her memory,
“Weetano must dwell in the Huron’s lodge to make
sure the bonds of peace. She would sooner die.”
And she wondered much whether the poor girl
would really undergo so great a sacrifice. Could
not her pale brother save her? Why had she not
counseled Weetano to make a confident of him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>From thoughts like these she was one day aroused
by her father, who observed, “There is something
on the lake that appears like a canoe; but it cannot
be the Mohawks, for it wants nearly two weeks of
the time specified for our visit. They may be stragglers
from some other tribe come to fish in the
Mohawks’ waters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But is there no danger, father? In our long
security I fancied I had become a stranger to fear;
but I find it revives upon the least suspicion of evil.
I am really less courageous than I imagined!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no cause for alarm, Anna. We have
injured none—have defrauded none. Moreover, an
Indian will not harm a Quaker—and <span class='it'>our garb at
least is true</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They watched the boat, and half an hour afterward
saw it approaching the cottage, when they recognized
the hawk’s-feathers—the well-known badge
of the Mohawks, and they strove in vain to conjecture
the cause of their sudden appearance. It
gained the landing-place, and to their surprise, there
sprang on shore a gentleman, clad in the garb of
their own nation. He paused a moment, as if giving
some directions to those he left behind, and then advanced
rapidly toward the abode of the emigrant.
Lord Temple went forth to meet him, and Anna
stole a cautious peep at the stranger whom her
father had gone to welcome. There was something
mysteriously familiar in that stranger’s look, as her
father’s greeting fell on his ears, and a faint smile
passed over his features; by that smile he was recognized.
She had never seen but one like it—it was
the same; and she sprang out, exclaiming, “Do you
not know him, father! We knew him well in dear
old England, and I know him even here! ’Tis
Francois Waldo—my old playmate, and teacher,
too;” and the next moment they were clasped in
each <a id='oth'></a>other’s arms—and Anna was shedding the happiest
tears that had ever dimmed her eyes, whilst
her father looked on in bewildered amazement,
scarcely able to determine whether the scene was
real, or one of the strange phantasms of slumber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After recovering a little from his astonishment,
however, he said, “Whence come you, my son, and
how in the world did you discover our hiding-place?
Strange! that the first white face which
has greeted us since our flight, should be that of a
dear old friend! But, tell me—how came you here
among the Quakers, as rigid a Puritan as you were
educated under our good Lord Protector?” And
Lord Temple greeted the new comer with a hearty
shake of the hand, accompanied with a significant
glance at his own altered attire!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came hither, my lord, with your friends, the
Mohawks, among whom I have been for nearly a
year captive. I have had suspicions that their new
pale face friends might possibly be yourselves, since
Weetano showed me the volume which she said
the White Lily had given her—for on the cover was
the name of Anna Temple. Still, with all my inquiries,
I could ascertain nothing with certainty,
for the old chief said you were ‘Blue Jackets!’
meaning Quakers; and that ‘on the head of his new
brother, John Brown, had fallen much snow.’ I remembered
you with raven locks, and thought not of
the changes a few years will sometimes occasion.
But tell me a little of your wanderings, for time urges
me back. Let me first, however, state the immediate
cause of this visit. Weetano is ill, and she has
entreated her father to send for Anna to his lodge,
that she may hear her talk again before she goes to
be the companion of spirits. The old chief is sorely
afflicted, for she is his only child, and he was soon
to have sealed with her hand an alliance with his
warlike neighbors, the Hurons. The young brave
to whom she is betrothed will soon be there; but,
if I can read the Indian girl aright, she shrinks from
the coming of Owanaw, though in my hearing she
has never spoken of him. However, she has nothing
to fear, for she will soon change her dwelling for a
long resting-place. Consumption is upon her. Will
you return with me, Anna? Can you undergo the
privations of an Indian wigwam for a few days?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, gladly! gladly! May I not go, father, to
nurse poor Weetano a little, or will you feel too
lonely in my absence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly should prefer to have Francois remain
with us,” replied Lord Temple, “but Oliwibatuc
has been a faithful friend; if his daughter is
sick, you shall go if he desires it; I believe I can
entrust you a few days with your old companion.
But how is the journey to be performed, my child?
You surely cannot walk from the opposite lake-shore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oliwibatuc ordered his trusty warriors to bear
her as they bore Red-Bird on her return,” replied
Francois. “I will see that she is not overwearied,
and secure from accident. Her carriage shall be
made firm, and I will be <span class='it'>her footman</span>—she shall be
<span class='it'>the Lady Anna</span> again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father proposed sending one of the old carriage-horses
round by Carle, but the young people
would not listen to the plan, for it would delay their
journey at least a whole day; and so Nurse Judy
was ordered to put up some medicine for Red-Bird,
with a few articles of necessary clothing for Anna—and
in a little time they were crossing the blue water,
Anna in a canoe with her father, who crossed the
lake with them, and Francois, with the dusky Mohawks,
among whom he was a great favorite, for
many a deed of kindness and charity had this young
captive-minister done for their tribe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The close of the second day found them approaching
the Mohawk village, and the journey had been
performed with the greatest ease by Anna—indeed,
two pleasanter days she had not passed since the
green lawns of England had been exchanged for the
western forest. Waldo had been accompanied by
eight young warriors, who, according to the fashion
of their nation, had constructed a light carriage of
green boughs and branches interwoven, which was
alternately carried forward by four of their number,
without the least inconvenience or fatigue. Borne
along thus by her fantastic guides, she felt not the
least emotion of fear. By her side was one who
watched her with the most unwearied care—who
plucked for her every flower in the wild pathway,
and brought her water from each cool spring. It
was the living form of one whose image had often
been with her in dreams, when the spirit’s messengers
link again the parted in sweet companionship.
They recounted to each other the story of
their wanderings, and each felt that time and absence
and sorrow had but strengthened the ties of
youthful affection; and the dark eye of Francois
had not been so lit up with sunshine since the days
long gone by, when his simple mountain reed awoke
a hundred echoes in the ear of the happy peasant-boy
of the Alps!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anna, too, was happy. O, how happy! as she
read in the earnest gaze ever fixed upon her that it
was her presence that had imparted unwonted color
to the pale cheek, and additional lustre to the dark
eye—but mournful memories would come flashing
over her mind, and the low, confiding tones of Red-Bird
would sound again in her ears—“Weetano has
looked on the face of her pale brother, and the image
of her brave has faded from her heart”—and for the
first time she felt in her spirit a rising of selfishness.
Poor Anna—there was a bitter struggle, but brief;
and her better nature was triumphant! No wonder,
she thought, the forest-maiden should love the fair-browed
captive who had come to her father’s wigwam
and saved her life! No wonder her ardent,
grateful heart should treasure up the rich, low tones
of her preserver, and turn with sickening disgust
from the stranger Huron! And, then she thought
of Weetano, sick and wasting away perhaps with an
untold sorrow, and she wished in her heart the love
of her red friend had been requited, even though the
bright spark she had so long nursed in her own
breast had gone out in another’s joy. The daughter
of the Indian chief was a fit mate for the gifted or
noble of any nation—one such had already shone
with peerless lustre at a royal court, and Weetano
was as rich in beauty and intellect as the far-famed
daughter of Powhatten!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the thoughts that rapidly coursed
through Anna’s brain, and when her companion announced
to her that they were already in view of
the village, and that Weetano was coming forth to
meet them, her heart leaped only with gladness—not
a trace of its tumultuous workings remained!
She soon descried her friend, supported by the old
chief, followed by a long train of warriors. She had
been borne forth on a couch to the outskirts of the
village to await the Pale-Lily, and now, weak and
feeble as she was, at her earnest entreaty, had been
permitted to walk forward a few steps to meet and
welcome her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they drew near Oliwibatuc stepped forward
and courteously presented a belt of wampum; and
Anna, seeing her friend for the moment unsupported,
sprang forward, and clasping her in her arms, exclaimed—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, darling sick, Red-Bird! I have come to
nurse you in your own home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pale-Lily has come in time,” she calmly replied.
“The summer is over, and the song of
Red-Bird will cease with the early frost. But you
are weary now—come to the feast of Oliwibatuc.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The couch of Weetano was now brought forward,
and she was laid gently thereon, and supported by
her father on one side, and on the other by Francois
and Anna, followed by those of her tribe who had
come forth to welcome the “Lily of the Pale face,”
she was borne back to her father’s wigwam. Here
a feast had been spread in honor of the expected
guest, of every variety which river and forest afforded,
and a soft, downy mat was spread for her
and Weetano beside the old chief, who seemed
pleased to see Anna smiling familiarly on the dusky
warriors whom she recognized as Oliwibatuc’s companions
of the past summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meal was taken in silence, and at its close
Red-Bird took Anna by the hand and led her to a
soft couch of furs, tastefully spread over with embroidered
blankets, side by side with her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The way was long for the weak Lily,” she said
in pleasant accents, “she must rest; Weetano will
watch her first slumber—it will be secure in the
lodge of the Mohawk chief. She will not fear,”
added she, in an inquiring manner; and placing her
hand at the same time in hers, Anna was struck with
its mortal coldness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you are cold, Weetano,” said she, pressing
the hand affectionately, “it is <span class='it'>you</span> who most need
rest, and I came to watch beside you—not <span class='it'>you</span> with
<span class='it'>me</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only to-night, white maiden; Red-Bird has
spread your couch with her own hands to-day, and
when she has seen you sleep she will lie down on
her couch beside you happy, though her heart is
frozen, and its streams are fast wasting. Slumber
will revive the weary Lily, and Weetano will sing
her a song of the Great Spirit. She has learned it
of her white brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus prevailed on, Anna Temple lay down on the
downy bed her friend had spread for her, but she
felt no disposition to sleep, for too many thoughts
came crowding thickly on her mind, and when, to
her surprise, the child of the dusky Mohawk half
sung, half chanted the “Cradle Hymn of the Shepherds,”
in a voice wildly musical, it brought back
with overpowering force the hours of her childhood
and the dimly remembered tones of her mother’s
voice, for that hymn had often been her lullaby.
She buried her face in the blankets, but in spite of
her utmost efforts her sobs reached the sharp ear of
her companion, who paused quickly in her hymn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does the song of Red-Bird make the tired Lily
weep? She meant it not so—but the wounded
bird has ever a mournful strain. She will sing no
more!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, nay, dear Weetano, it is not that; but
long years ago my mother used to sing me that
hymn, and it seemed so very strange that its echo
should come back to me far away in these dim old
woods. Francois Waldo must have heard it, too,
among the Alpine hills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the mention of that name Weetano started
slightly, and looking earnestly at Anna, said—“I
remember those words—the Frenchman spoke them—they
mean my pale brother. You knew him, then,
over the great waters?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Weetano. I knew him there. His enemies
burnt his home and murdered his parents—then he
fled to my country for shelter. Did I not tell you
once of the peasant-boy and his poor little sister
Christine? He used to be my tutor there, in my
first home—that is all, Weetano.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, maiden, doth thy heart whisper truly?
Listen! When he read the name on the beautiful
book which the Lily gave to Red-Bird, his brow
grew whiter, and his eyelids quivered like the poplar
before the storm. ’Tis not every breath that moves
my brother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shrewd girl’s artifice revealed a truth which
the lips denied, and the heart would fain have concealed;
but those few words had called it forth, and
it was written on every lineament of her face too
plainly for an eye less penetrating than an Indian’s
to have mistaken its import. Weetano smiled
meaningly on her confused and trembling companion,
and continued—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why would you hang mist before the eyes of
Red-Bird? Did she not trust the white maiden, and
does she suppose the daughter of the Mohawk cannot
hold her tongue?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, nay; you wrong me, Weetano. ’Tis but
now I learned that my old companion dwelt in the
Mohawk’s lodge. Had not my sister already told
me before, ‘that she had looked on the face of her
white brother and a new life had been awakened in
her heart.’ Should the Lily pluck the sweet morsel
from the taste of Red-Bird? No, she is not so selfish—she
would sooner feed her with her own heart’s
food.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the food is poison for Weetano, she will not
eat it,” persisted she, somewhat mournfully. “My
brother loves the fair maiden of his own land—why
should he not! Oliwibatuc, too, would have given
his daughter to a dog sooner than to an idle ‘book
man.’ When he brought the hatchet and bow of
my dead brother and gave them to his captive, he
turned away from them and spoke the words of
peace, and the warrior sighed—‘Who will hang the
trophies of Olo in his father’s wigwam? By his true
spirit Weetano shall wed a brave, and he shall be
the chief of the Mohawks instead of Olo!’ He has
spoken, but the Great Spirit loves Weetano, and
will not give her to the Huron, for he will soon lay
her beside the still waters to slumber, and the Lily
shall bloom for my new brother. Nay, do not weep
so—the eye of Weetano can now see the path plainly,
and the way looks pleasant, but she was sorry to
leave her new brother alone, for though he toils hard
to do the Mohawks good they are not his own people,
and I know he must sometimes be very sad and
lonely. It was for this I plead for him to bring you
hither; I knew you were his spirit-mate, and longed
to see you both happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anna Temple gazed long and earnestly on the
beautiful face that bent over her couch, but was unable
to trace thereon a shadow of emotion; its expression
was calm and unvarying, and though the
clear, dark eyes sparkled brightly, the light they shed
was as the brightness of a silver fountain that reflects
the moonbeams from its surface soft and almost holy.
Her own heart beat wildly, and when she attempted
to speak, her voice was choked and broken with
sobs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, Weetano, do not speak so low and mournfully,”
she at length uttered. “You will still live
and be happy, you are so good and true! Nurse
Judy has sent some medicine, and I know well how
to administer it; then I have something else to offer
beside; so bend down your ear close to me, Weetano,
and I will whisper it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Weetano did as she was desired, and whatever the
words of her companion might have been, they had
no effect on the Indian girl, for when she raised
her head the same serene smile rested on her features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The heart of Red-Bird would be weak, indeed,
to listen to the words,” she replied. “The white
maiden has not read it rightly, for its pride is as
stern as the rock of her mountains, that may be
broken but cannot be bowed. It fears not the blast!
Weetano’s heart is like it—it will bide its lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And its lot may yet be happy—yea, I am persuaded
it will be, only do not indulge in dark fancies,
Weetano.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Weetano has no dark fancies now! Sunshine
has broken through the dim future since the words
of the Lily’s book fell on her ears. The shadowy
land has no fears now, and beautiful images beckon
me there in slumber! Weetano will come again
with messages of good to the Lily and her pale brother,
for they taught her the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning Anna awoke early, and refreshed,
although her slumber had not been unbroken;
for whenever she stirred the dark eyes of Weetano
were fixed upon her with the same placid smile that
had greeted her coming, and sorely, bitterly did her
heart ache for the poor creature who regarded her
with an affection so earnest and grateful. She
feigned sleep at length, fearing her friend would become
exhausted with care for her, but when the low,
soft breathing of Weetano assured her she had relapsed
from her watching, she turned away from her
and wet her couch with tears. When she awoke in
the morning, Weetano still slept, and she arose noiselessly,
lest she might disturb her; but when some
time passed and she still betrayed no signs of waking,
Anna seated herself beside her couch, murmuring
softly, “This sleep will do her good—she looks
so happy now.” Her dark, glossy locks had fallen
over her forehead, and she stroked them gently back,
smiling on the beautiful picture before her, for though
the cheek of Weetano had lost its roundness, the
outline was still perfect, and still she was marvelously
beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour or more passed on, and Anna had not left
the side of the sleeping maiden. Over her features
brooded the same tranquil repose, so hushed indeed,
that she would often bend down her ear to catch the
low breathing, and satisfy her mind that there was nothing
unnatural in a repose so profound. Without
she heard the murmur of voices, and cautious footsteps,
for only a hanging of skins separated them
from the large, open space where the feast had been
spread the evening previous, and where breakfast
was now preparing. At length an old Indian woman
peeped cautiously from behind the curtain, and seeing
Anna already dressed, she came forward with a look
of surprise that her companion was yet sleeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” said she, “is not the daughter of the
chief risen? ’Tis her custom to rise with the
dawn; she must be weary with the labor of yesterday.
Oliwibatuc gave orders not to disturb you,
thinking the white maiden would need rest; but Red-Bird
has slept long now, we will break her slumber.
Weetano, Weetano!” said the Indian woman, “the
sun is high in the east, ’tis time the Lily should eat
something, Oliwibatuc has called for his daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A smothered murmur escaped from her lips, like
one half aroused to consciousness, and the eyelids
unclosed for a moment, but were soon heavy with
sleep again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wake up, wake up, Weetano,” continued she,
“the morning is fair, and the air as fragrant as the
month of flowers. The chief will take you forth to
sail on the river—wake up maiden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Weetano breathed a low sigh, and there was a
struggle, like one who strives to burst a charm.
The effort seemed ineffectual, but she spoke faintly,
“Weetano is weary, Zohah—leave her to rest a
little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, let her rest,” whispered Anna, “she will
gain strength, and I will watch beside her until she
awakens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The maiden sleeps strangely,” muttered the old
woman, as she retreated behind the curtain, leaving
Anna to resume her watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another hour passed by, and she ventured to lift
the hand that had fallen over the blankets of her
couch—it was soft and warm as a slumbering infant’s.
She pressed it in her own, whispering,
“Weetano, Weetano!” and a happy smile passed
over the features of her companion, and the pressure
of her hand was gently returned. “She must have
watched longer than I supposed,” thought Anna,
“and is exhausted with the effort; it would be wrong
to disturb her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She arose and lifted the curtain, for it was growing
late, and she began to feel faint and weary herself;
no one was to be seen, and she went forward to the
open air. Oliwibatuc was sitting on the ground, at
a little distance from the lodge, with a number of his
warriors in an idle manner, but when he saw Anna
standing in the door of the wigwam, he came forward
with a smile on his dark, grim features, and
said—“The Lily has slumbered long; was she
wearied with her journey through the woods?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, chief, very little,” she replied. “ ’Tis Red-Bird
who is fatigued, and she still slumbers; I have
watched her for hours, but her sleep was so quiet I
would not waken her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what aileth the maiden,” he exclaimed;
“she was never last to leave her couch, but her
song has been sad of late, and her feet have trod
lightly in the wood-paths. She hath leaned on the
strong for support. I will rouse her myself, while
Zohah helps you to break the long fast of the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anna partook lightly of some refreshments from
the hand of Zohah, while the chief went to Red-Bird;
but he soon returned with a satisfied air, saying,
“She sleeps well; I will let her rest until we
go forth with the canoe on the river.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was high in the heaven and the daughter
of the chief had not awakened! Hour after hour had
Anna Temple lingered by the low bed-side, while her
repose seemed only deepening, and an indefinite fear
crept over her—a mysterious sense of evil, and she
felt sad and lonely. Near the curtain sat the old
chief, for he, too, seemed ill at ease, and Anna put
aside the skin hanging, and said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall not we rouse her now, chief; she must
require nourishment, and this long sleep alarms
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say you so, maiden; the slumber must then be
broken, for I, too, have fears! Wake up, Red-Bird!”
said he, advancing toward her, “ ’tis noonday,
you must not sleep;” and he shook her gently by
the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She partially opened her eyes, murmuring as before—“Weetano
is weary—let her rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take some food, first, Weetano,” said Anna,
imploringly; “don’t go to sleep again for I am very
lonely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of her voice seemed to reanimate her
for a moment, and looking round, she said, “Where
is my brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone,” said the chief, “to his daily toil, (for
every day he visited the sick of the tribe,) but he
will be here soon to go forth with us on the river.
Rouse up then.” But the head of Weetano was
drooping again like a sleeping flower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drop the curtain, and let in more air and light,”
said Anna in a beseeching tone, “she is faint and
languid; something must be done to revive her.
<span class='it'>What can we do!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send for the ‘medicine man,’ ” said old Zohah;
“he will arouse her if any one can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, send for Francois Waldo quickly,” exclaimed
Anna Temple; “his voice may have power
to break this dreadful slumber.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oliwibatuc made a motion with his hand for
some one to depart, but his eyes were fixed earnestly
on the prostrate form of his daughter. “Raise
her up, Zohah,” said he to the old woman, who
was wetting her lips with some beverage, “perhaps
she will drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They pillowed her up on her couch, and Anna
knelt there beside her, taking her hand in her own
and supporting her head on her shoulder, while she
vainly endeavored to render her conscious by numerous
questions. The messenger soon returned, accompanied
by the young missionary, who had
hastened at the first mention of Weetano’s illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has been the matter with Red-Bird?”
asked he in a whisper, at the same time regarding
her closely. “She sleeps quietly now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has slept thus all day, and will not waken,”
replied Anna, bursting into tears. “O, Francois,
can you not arouse her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Thus</span>, did you say—has she slept peacefully all
day? ’Tis strange,” added he, taking her hand,
“her pulse beats well, and her breathing is regular:
has she spoken?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two or three times,” replied Zohah. “Once she
inquired for you. Let her know you have come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Weetano, Weetano!” said he, bending his lips
close to her ear, “speak to your brother, Weetano—he
has come back from his toil. Will not his sister
welcome him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those tones fell not unheeded; there was another
struggle as if to burst the leaden chain, and an expression
of happiness spread like sunlight over her
features. Her dark eyes were again unsealed, and
a momentary brightness fell from beneath the long
lashes, as she said faintly, “Weetano heard her brother’s
voice in her dream, but she cannot awaken to
its music—her slumber is not over;” and her voice
died away in a murmur, like the lingering pulsations
of a harp, and her head hung heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All through the long afternoon did they labor to
break that strange lethargy, but no care or remedy
proved successful, and her breath grew shorter and
fainter until evening, when she revived a little, and
looked consciously on all around. The old chief
was near, gazing mournfully on his drooping child,
and beside her were Francois Waldo and Anna
Temple, upon whom she still leaned for support.
She bestowed on each a look of the most earnest
affection, then said, in clear, unbroken accents—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Lily will brighten my brother’s pathway,
but Oliwibatuc will be alone! You will not forsake
my father,” continued she, fixing her dark eye on
the pale youth before her, inquiringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never, Weetano, I promise in the sight of
heaven, while I live he shall find in me a son to
lean upon; he has been as a father to his captive—I
will never desert him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you,” she said, pressing his hand to her
lips—“Your words are true.” Then placing the
hand of Anna Temple in that of her white brother,
with a quiet smile she closed her eyes again for their
last slumber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All night the spirit of Weetano clung to its earthly
tenement, and the morning found it still hovering
around its beautiful abode, as if unwilling to forsake
its companionship. The lodge was filled with the
sorrowing faces of those who had gathered to obtain
a last look of the daughter of their chief, who lay
there in their midst like a breathing statue—but
while the dew still lingered on the flower, the lips
of the sleeper parted gently, her eyelids quivered—a
momentary shudder passed over her frame, and the
strife was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captive Red-Bird had at last burst her prison
bars, and unfolded her wings in the sunnier bowers
of the spirit-land. One by one those who had gathered
near to witness the last moments of the chief’s
daughter went forth, that Oliwibatuc might stand
alone in the presence of his dead. Francois and
Anna withdrew to a little distance from the couch
of the dear departed, and gazed with tearful faces on
the old warrior, who stood with a mournful face
gazing on the last of his household! He stooped at
length, and took the hand, scarcely yet cold, in his
own, and, pronounced in an unbroken tone an Indian
farewell:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Great Spirit help thee on thy journey, my
daughter—the way is long and fearful! Thou art
a tender bird to try the unseen path alone, but let not
thy wing falter in the misty valley, for the blue hills
are shining brightly beyond! Pass onward—thy
mother hath spread her couch there; thou art the
last bird of our nest, and she waiteth for thee! Tell
her—her warrior hath dwelt alone in his wigwam
since we laid her by the quiet river! Tell her—that
thou alone hast been the sunbeam of his lodge, and
hast spread the couch of the weary! O, Weetano!
thy father is lonely now—why didst thou go before
him to the dwelling-place of the happy? The hunter
will come to his wigwam weary at evening, but
the torch will not be lighted, for Weetano will not be
there! His cup will be empty, and his board desolate!
No song shall lull him to slumber, for Red-Bird
has gone to her mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old chief’s voice faltered here, for the first
time; and he bowed his head. They saw him brush
a tear from his eye—then another rolled down his
dusky face, and Anna would have rushed to his side
to pour forth her sympathy, had not Francois withheld
her—he knew, better than her, the customs of the
people among whom he dwelt, that they share with
none their woes, but bear their burden alone. The
momentary struggle was past, and Oliwibatuc spoke
again, calmly, but with lower, sadder tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Weetano, thou hast led us in all thy beauty!
Thou hast gathered up the flowers of a few summers—but
the great snows have not fallen on thee! I
will lay thee gently by thy mother, and the braves
shall rear the green mound, where I will sit with my
bow at evening, gazing on the bright hills of the far
south-west. Farewell! Weetano, I go to make thy
grave by the river-side!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew himself up to his full height, and passed
slowly out of his wigwam, and Anna now went forward,
and stood sobbing by the couch where darling
Red-Bird lay as in a peaceful slumber. How short to
her the period since she first beheld her a creature
radiant with health and beauty—the fleetest fawn of
the wilderness—the gayest bird on the wing! But
how soon had all this glory and beauty departed.
Weetano had lived, loved, suffered, and died. Thus
had she fulfilled her woman’s lot; early indeed—but
fully and truly. There remained but to lay her in
her last resting-place, according to the custom of her
nation, without coffin or shroud—but what matter?
Beside her grave the clear tones of the young Vaudois
preacher pronounced—“<span class='it'>The dead shall be
raised</span>,” and as his voice went up in prayer, there, in
the mighty forest, the red warriors looked at him in
wondering silence, and the captive “Book Man”
was a mystery.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Ten years after the events noticed in our last chapter,
a pleasant village was rapidly springing upon the
sunny lake-side, so long tenanted only by the lonely
refugees. The broad old forest had been rudely cut
away by the axe of the settler, and cottage-homes
were reared thickly side by side. The emigrant’s
hut had been transformed into an elegant mansion,
whilst the green lawn in front, sloping down to the
water, and planted with shrubbery and vines—was
the play-ground of happy children. At a little distance,
among the trees, a pretty church raised its slender
spire toward heaven, and behind it, several mounds
of fresh earth told plainly there was no retreat from
death. But who was the dark-haired pastor that had
first awakened the voice of prayer in that remote settlement?
The imagination of the reader will furnish
a ready reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oliwibatuc had gone to his rest! Faithfully, had
his devoted young captive labored to sow with good
seed the hearts of his red brethren, and in some instances,
the scalping-knife and tomahawk had been
buried by the living warrior; but after the death of
the old chief, he had taken up his abode with Lord
Temple, having been married to Anna soon after the
death of Red-Bird. Long and happily did they dwell
together, wondering much that an over-ruling providence
should have watched over the divided current
of their lives, and united them so mysteriously in a
far, foreign land. Lord Temple lived until his head
was white with four-score years; but until death retained
his Quaker dress and appellation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That village is now a beautiful and flourishing
town in the heart of the old empire State. The lone
canoe of the Indian long since disappeared from the
blue lake, but hundreds of snowy sails now whiten
its waters. Few of the busy multitude that now
throng these streets, could point the curious traveler
to the spot on which stood the humble cottage of the
first settler—many would not even remember his
name; but go to the ancient records, and there you
will find that as early as 1660, a wealthy Quaker,
calling himself John Brown, made purchase of a large
territory of the Mohawk chief, and settled upon it
with his own family—that he afterward built a church
of the <span class='it'>Presbyterian order</span>, and endowed it with a
fund, for its after-support, and left at his death many
rich legacies. It is also added, that much mystery
shrouded the aforesaid Brown, and by some he
was supposed to have been an associate of Oliver
Cromwell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An elegant edifice stands now on the site of the
little church of the first settler; but the burying-yard
behind it remains unchanged, and there on a
broad slab may still be traced, a long obituary of John
Brown, the earliest settler, and by his side sleeps the
first pastor of that ancient church, of whom it is recorded,
that he labored for a number of years as a
faithful missionary among the Mohawks, by whom
he was taken captive; and, afterward, for nearly
forty years, as the minister of the first church of
Christ in the wilderness. By his side, sleeps Anna,
his wife—and children, and children’s children are
around in long ranks, with the slumber of years upon
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reader! My story is brought to a close. It but
feebly illustrates the chance and change of life—but
if it serve to awaken a more earnest interest in those
who have gone before us, its author will not have
spent those few pleasant hours amid the records of
the past in vain. Life is not all with us! Those
who trod the paths we are now treading, knew as
much of its joys and sorrows—perchance even more
than ourselves, and would we search more deeply
the annals of our forefathers, our toil would often be
rewarded with histories as full of vicissitude and adventure,
as that of the illustrious Judge Temple, or
the Vaudois peasant-boy of the Alps!</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Away in music. Silent symphonies,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The spirit gathered, weaving into wings,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To waft it up through space-encircling seas,</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;My ever eager eyes, with quenchless thirst,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Commingling mountains, indistinct at first</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And far, sublimely rose: each range would o’er</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Like some vast army on the Appenines,</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Below me slept a valley, with its fields</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And harvesters, whose distance-mellowed peals</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of laughter touched the ear, as echoes borne</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;At vesper hour from some far Alpine horn,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Reclined, at length, beside a narrow stream</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;That lingered lullingly beneath its worn,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Wild-blossomed banks awhile, and then would gleam</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Slow sloping shores, o’er-velveted with green—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Old oaks, which, sighing softly, seemed aware</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Round age’s mem’ries, as at eventide,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I felt the perfume-freighted zephyrs glide</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;On tiptoe by me from the midst of these:</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And as they whispered lowly, by degrees</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;My brain grew dizzy with felicity;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And fancy, with the warm realities,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Mingled such floating, fairy imagery,</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;There seemed low music swelling from afar.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Which, as it nearer came, grew lovelier;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And then smooth, iv’ry voices, such as are</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Heard only from some heavenly messenger,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With harp-like pinions, warning ere we err</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In words that die not, and through after time,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;When evil tempts us, draw us nearer her.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And as in thought I saw the Past, sublime,</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The cooling rippling of the stream of song</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And skimming swift the waves with ear and eye,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I found the fountains whence the river came—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A group of singing sylphs—and standing by</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The one that <span class='it'>looked</span> the queen, though robed the same,</p>
<p class='line0'>And languishingly lovely—Idleness her name.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Her dark, luxuriant hair fell loosely o’er</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A neck that said a thousand things unthinking,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And soft as if ’twere only fashioned for</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A pillow to support a loved head sinking</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Beneath the draught, deliriously drinking,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of her resistless beauty; and her eyes</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Were open volumes, which, like planets blinking,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Seemed saying, “Read us, all around us lies</p>
<p class='line0'>The starry Infinite—the realm of Mysteries.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Her thoughts environed me, for with a smile</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And gesture of her hand, the group arose;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And pausing as they neared me, for awhile,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Drew round, encircling, in converging rows,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Enshrouding me in incense. A repose</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Crept through my senses, such as sweetly stole</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Over the Lotus-eaters—such as throws</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Its dreamy spells around the bounding soul,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like silken lassos, where the waves of Lethé roll.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And I was borne aloft through azure air,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Her warm, white arms around me, and her cheek</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Close pressed to mine; her cooling, curling hair</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Bathing my temples, as in Easter week,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In Rome’s cathedrals, ere the Fathers speak,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;My burning, lightning-learning lips would seek</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With hers communion; and though undisclosed</p>
<p class='line0'>The secrets whispered, yet our hearts full well supposed.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;We floated on, with wings extended wide,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To that fair region, where the thoughts of men,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The holiest they breathe, like angels glide,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Gathering the purely beautiful, and then</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Returning laden to the earth again—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Imagination’s realm—the vast Unknown,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Full of as glorious images as when</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The first Thought-angel gazed within, alone,</p>
<p class='line0'>And will be while the world has evil to atone.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I touched Futurity’s thrice veiled domain.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And felt the moments of swift coming years</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Fall sparklingly around me, like the rain</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;From over-heavy clouds of unwept tears,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Dropping through sunlight; while my eager ears</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Caught from far sounding avenues, a name</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Like mine, breathed in the tones affection hears</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Swelling so sweetly on the earth the same,</p>
<p class='line0'>Though lowly laid in flowers, the lips from whence they came.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;My brain reeled with repletion, and no more,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Through such celestial scenes, and thus to be</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Clothed with mortality, could I explore.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Fading, still fading slowly, I could see</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The rolling prairie-land of Poesy,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Blooming with stars, and eastwardly a light,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Like the full moon rising gloriously,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Which streamed o’er it from Heaven—then our flight,</p>
<p class='line0'>Unwilled, was earthward, with the soul’s archangel, Night.</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And darker, colder ones in store may be</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Unopened, with the woes awaiting men:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> we see an insect in the fields pumping a
sweet fluid from the nectaries of flowers, and carrying
it home and storing it in convenient receptacles,
which it carefully covers so as to exclude the dust
and hinder evaporation, we are filled with devout
astonishment; and as we write hymns about the
“Little Busy Bee,” in her industry and foresight,
and curious contrivances, we recognize an all-pervading
Mind and an all-controlling Hand. And in
this we are right. But here is another animal, still
more resourceful and provident. The bee collects
the honey from such flowers as happen to contain it,
and which yield it almost ready-made; but she takes
no trouble to secure a succession of those flowers or
to increase their productiveness. This other creature
is at infinite pains to propagate and improve his
favorite mellifluent herbs. From the sweet juices
of flowers the bee can only elaborate a single fluid,
while her rival from the same syrup can obtain a
multitude of dainties; and, according to the taste of
the consumer, he offers it in the guise of nectar or
ambrosia, in crystals of topaz or in pyramids of snow.
And when the manufacture is complete, the bee
knows only one mode of stowage; this other creature
packs it, as the case may require, in bags or baskets,
in boxes or barrels, all his own workmanship, and
all cleverly made. What, then, is the reason that
when we look at a honeycomb we are apt to be
reminded of the wisdom and goodness of God; but
looking at the same thing magnified—surveying a
hundred hogsheads of sugar piled up in a West
Indian warehouse—we have no devout associations
with the ingenuity and industry which placed them
there? Why are chords of pious feeling struck by
the proceedings of an insect, and no emotion roused
by the on-goings of our fellow-men?</p>

<p class='pindent'>We examine two paper-mills. The one is situated
in a gooseberry-bush, and the owner is a wasp.
The other covers some acres of land, and belongs to
a kind-hearted and popular legislator. But after
exploring the latter with all its water-wheels and
steam-engines, and with all the beautiful expedients
for converting rags into pulp, and then weaving and
sizing, and cutting and drying, and folding and packing,
we go away admiring nothing except human
skill; whereas, the moment Madam Vespa fetches
a bundle of vegetable fibres and moistens them with
her saliva, and then spreads them out in a patch of
whitey-brown, we lift our hands in amazement, and
go home to write another “Bridgewater Treatise,”
or to add a new meditation to Sturm. That a wasp
should make paper at all is very wonderful; but if
the rude fabric which she compiles from raspings of
wood is wonderful, how much more admirable is
that texture which, as it flows from between these
flying cylinders for furlongs together, becomes a fit
repository for the story of the universe, and can receive
on its delicate and evenly expanse, not only
the musings of genius but the pictures of Prophecy
and the lessons of Inspiration!</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, it is said, the cases are quite distinct.
Man has reason to guide him; the lower animal proceeds
by instinct. In surveying human handiwork,
we admire the resources of reason; in looking at
bird architecture or insect manufactures, we are in
more direct contact with the Infinite Mind. Their
Maker is their teacher, but man is his own instructor;
and, therefore, we see the wisdom and goodness
of God in the operations of the lower animals
more clearly than in our own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without arguing the identity of reason and instinct,
it will be admitted that the lower animals
frequently perform actions which imply a reasoning
process. Reverting to our insect illustrations, Huber
and others have mentioned cases which make
it hard to deny judgment and reflection to the wasp;
and the reader who is himself “judicious” will not
refuse a tiny measure of his own endowments to the
bee. On a bright day, four or five summers since,
we were gazing at a clump of fuchsias planted out
on a lawn, not far from London. As every one
knows, the flower of the fuchsia is a graceful pendent,
something like a funnel or red coral suspended
with the opening downward; and in the varieties
planted on this lawn the tube of the funnel was long
and slender. In the case of every expanded flower,
we noticed that there was a small hole near the
apex, just as if some one had pierced it with a pin.
It was not long till we detected the authors of these
perforations. The border was all alive with bees,
and we soon noticed that in dealing with the fuchsias
they extracted the honey through these artificial
apertures. They had found the tube of the blossom
so long that their haustella could not reach the honey
at its farther end; and so, by this engineering stratagem,
they got at it sideways. Surely this was
sensible. When a mason releases a sweep stuck
fast in a chimney by digging a hole in the gable, or
when a chancellor of the exchequer gains a revenue
by indirect taxation, he merely carries out the principle.
And what makes the manœuvre more striking,
is the fact that the problem was new. The
fuchsias had come from Mexico and Chili not many
years ago; whereas the bees were derived from a
long line of English ancestors, and could not have
learned the art of tapping from their American congeners.
In cases such as these, and hundreds which
might be quoted, no one feels his admiration of the
all-pervading Wisdom lessen as instinct approaches
reason, or actually merges in it. In the case of the
inferior animals no one feels—The more of reason,
the less of God. And, because man is all reason
together, why should it be thought that in human inventions
and operations there is nothing divine?
How is it that in the dyke-building of that beaver,
or the nest building of that bird, so many mark the
varied evolutions of the Supreme Intelligence; but,
when they come to the operations of the artisan or
the architect, they are conscious of an abrupt transition,
and, feeling the groundless holy, they exclaim,</p>

<p class='line0'>“God made the country, but man made the town?”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>One would think that the right way to regard human
handiwork is with the feelings which an accomplished
naturalist expresses:—“A reference to
the Deity, even through works of human invention,
must lead to increased brotherly love among mankind.
When we see a mechanic working at his
trade, and observe the dexterity which he displays,
together with the ingenious adaptation of his tools
to their various uses, and then consider the original
source of all this, do we not see a being at work,
employing for his own purposes an intelligence derived
from the Almighty?—and will not such a consideration
serve to raise him in our opinion, rather
than induce us to look down slightingly upon him for
being employed in a mechanical trade? For my
own part, when I watch a mechanic at his work I
find it very agreeable, and, I believe, a very useful
kind of mental employment, to think of him as I
would of an insect building its habitation, and in both
see the workings of the Deity.”<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet it must be admitted that few have the feelings
which Mr. Drummond describes. They cannot
see as much of God in the manipulations of the
mechanic as in the operations of the bird or the
beaver; nor can a life-boat send their thoughts upward
so readily as the shell of a nautilus or the float
of a raft-building spider.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The difference is mainly moral. Man is sinful.
Many of his works are constructed with sinful motives,
and are destined for evil purposes. And the
artificer is often a wicked man. We know this, and
when we look on man’s works we cannot help remembering
this. It is a pure pleasure to watch a
hive of bees, but it is not so pleasant to survey a
sugar plantation in Brazil, there is a painful thought
in knowing how much of their produce will be manufactured
into intoxicating liquors. It is pleasant to
observe the paper-making of a hymenopterous insect;
for it does not swear nor use bad language at
its work, and, when finished, its tissues will not be
blotted by effusions of impiety and vice; but of this
you can seldom be assured in the more splendid
manufactures of us lords of the creation. But if this
element were guaranteed—if the will of God were
done among ourselves even as it is done among
the high artificers of heaven and among the humble
laborers in earth’s deep places—our feelings
should be wholly revolutionized. If of every stately
fabric we knew, as we know regarding St. Paul’s,
that no profane word had been uttered all the time
of its construction; if of every factory we could hope,
as of the mills at Lowell, that it is meant to be the
reward of good conduct and the gymnasium of intelligence
and virtue; if of every fine painting or statue
we might believe that, like Michael Angelo’s works,
it was commenced in prayer; this suffusion of the
moral over the mechanical would sanctify the Arts,
and in Devotion’s breast it would kindle the conviction,
at once joyful and true, “My Father made
them all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, however, in man’s works, we are bound to
distinguish these two things—the mechanical and
the moral. When God made man at first, he made
him both upright and intelligent; he endowed him
with both goodness and genius. In his fall he has
lost a large amount of both attributes; but whatever
measure of either he retains is still divine. Any
dim instincts of devotion, as well as every benevolent
affection which lingers in man’s nature are
relics of his first estate; and so is any portion of intellectual
power which he still possesses. Too often
they exist asunder. In our self-entailed economy
of defect and disorder, too often are the genius and
the goodness divided. Too many of our good men
want cleverness, and too many clever men are bad.
But, whether consecrated or misdirected, it must
not be forgotten that talent, genius, dexterity, are
gifts of God, and that all their products, so far as
these are innocent or useful, are results of an original
inspiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is true that his Creator has not made each individual
man an instinctive constructor of railways
and palaces, as he has made each beaver a constitutional
dyke-builder and each mole a constitutional
tunnel-borer. But he has endowed the human
race with faculties and tendencies, which,
under favoring circumstances, shall eventually develop
in railways and palaces as surely as beaver
mind has all along developed in dykes, and mole
mind worked in tunnels. And just as in carrying
out His own great scheme with our species, the
Most High has conveyed great moral truths through
all sorts of messengers—through a Balaam and a
Caiaphas as well as a Daniel and a John;—so, in
carrying out His merciful plan, and gradually augmenting
our sum of material comfort, the Father
of earth’s families has conveyed His gifts through
very various channels, sometimes sending into our
world a great discovery through a scoffing philosopher,
and sometimes through a Christian sage. Be
the craftsman what he may; when once we have
separated the moral from the mechanical—the sin
which is man’s from the skill which is Jehovah’s—in
every exquisite product, and more especially in
every contribution to human comfort, we ought to
recognize as their ultimate origin the wisdom and
goodness of God. The arts themselves are His gift;
the abuse alone is human. And just as an enlightened
Christian looks forth on the landscape, and in
its fair features as well as its countless inhabitants
beholds mementoes of his Master; so, surveying a
beautiful city, its museums and its monuments, its
statues and fountains, or sauntering through a gallery
of art or useful inventions—in all the symmetry of
proportion and splendor of coloring, in every ingenious
device and every powerful engine, he may
read manifestations of that mind which is “wonderful
in counsel and excellent in working;” and,
so far as skill and adaptation and elegance are involved,
piety will hail the Great Architect himself
as the Maker of the Town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reason may be regarded as the Instinct of the human
race. Like instinct, commonly so called, it has
an irresistible tendency toward certain results; and
when circumstances favor, these results evolve. But
reason is a slow and experimental instinct. It is
long before it attains to any optimism. The inferior
races are only repeating masterpieces which their
ancestor produced in the year of the world One.
Man is constantly improving on his models, and
there are many inventions on which he has only hit
in this 59th century of his existence. Nevertheless,
as the oak is in the acorn, so these inventions have
from the first been in the instinct of humanity.
That is, if you say that its nest was in the mind of
the bird, or its cocoon in the mind of the silk-worm
as it came from the hand of its Maker, and if you
consequently deem it true and devout to recognize
in these humble fabrics a trace of the wisdom which
moulds the universe; so we say that the Barberini
Vase and the Britannia Bridge existed in the mind
of our species when first ushered into this earthly
abode, and now in the providential progress of events
these germs have developed in structures of beauty
or grandeur, whilst admiring the human workmanship,
it is right and it is comely to adore the original
Authorship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His are the minerals and the metals, the timbers
and the vegetable tissues, from which our houses
and our ships, our clothing and our furniture, are
fabricated. Of these, the variety is amazing, and it
plainly indicates that, in the arrangements of this
planet, the Creator contemplated not only the necessities
but the enjoyments of his intelligent creatures.
For instance, there might have been only one or two
metals; and the eagerness with which tribes confined
to copper, or to gold and silver, grasp at an axe
or a butcher’s whittle, shows how rich are the
tribes possessing iron. But even that master-metal,
with all his capabilities, and aided by his three predecessors,
cannot answer every purpose. The
chemist requires a crucible which will stand a powerful
heat, and which, withal, does not yield to the
corroding action of air or water. Gold would answer
the latter, and iron the former purpose, well;
but every one knows how readily iron rusts and how
easily gold melts. But there is another metal—platinum—on
which air and water have not the slightest
action, and which stands unscathed in the eye of a
furnace where iron would run down like wax, and
gold would burn like paper. In the same way there
are many ends for which none of these metals are
available, but which are excellently answered by
tin, and lead, and zinc, and rhodium, and mercury.
Or will the reader bestow a passing thought on his
apparel? His forefathers found one garment sufficient,
and for mere protection from the weather a
suit of cat-skin or sheep-skin might still suffice. But,
oh reader! what a romance is your toilette! and
should all the rest of you be prose, what a poem you
become when you put on your attire! That snowy
lawn once blossomed on the banks of the Don or the
Dnieper, and before it shone in a London drawing-room,
that broad-cloth comforted its rightful owner
amidst the snows of the Cheviots. Did these boots
really speak for themselves, you would find that the
upper leathers belonged to a goat, and the soles to a
horse or a cow. And could such metamorphic retributions
happen now as in the days of Ovid, the best
way to punish the pride of an exquisite would be to
let every creature come and recover his own. A
worm would get his satin cravat, and a pearl oyster
his studs; and if no fabulous beaver laid claim to his
hat, the rats of Paris or the kittens of Worcester
would assuredly run off with his gloves. But
viewed in a graver and truer light, it is marvellous
from how many sources we derive the several ingredients
in the simplest clothing, many of them
essential to health, and most of them conducive to
our well-being; so that we need not go to the
crowded mart or the groaning wharf in order to convince
ourselves of earth’s opulent resources. Few
will read these pages who have not the evidence at
home. Open that cupboard, unlock that wardrobe,
look round the chamber where you are seated, and
think a little of all the kingdoms of Nature and all
the regions of the globe from which their contents
have been collected, and say if the Framer of this
world is not a bountiful Provider. “O Lord, how
manifold are thy works! The earth is full of thy
riches; so is this great and wide sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Supreme Governor has so ordered it, that the
progress of the arts—that is, of human comfort and
accommodation—shall be nearly in proportion to
human industry, sobriety, and peacefulness. The
last thirty years have been fraught with inventions,
chiefly because they have been years of peace. In
England, however, the reign of Charles II. was tolerably
tranquil; but, except for the accident of Newton
and the Royal Society, its peace was the parent
of few discoveries, for it was a peace which had
converted the noise of the warrior, not into the quiet
of the artisan, but into the din of the drunken debauchee.
Such honor does the Most High put upon
peaceful activity and sober perseverance, that wherever
these exist economic comfort is sure to follow.
Thus, without uncommon intellectuality, and with
a false religion, the Chinese anticipated many of the
arts of modern Europe. Whilst Christendom, so
called, was divided betwixt lazy monks and a brutal
soldiery—whilst mediæval churchmen were droning
masses, and feudal barons amused themselves in
knocking out each other’s brains—the Chinese, neither
fierce nor indolent, were spinning silk and manufacturing
porcelain, compiling almanacs, and sinking
Artesian wells. And long before any Friar Schwartz,
or Gutenberg, or Flavio di Gioia, had revealed
them to the Western World, the pacific and painstaking
Chinese were favored with prelibations of our
vaunted discoveries—gunpowder, book-printing, and
the mariner’s compass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have compared our world to a well-furnished
dwelling, in which, however, many of the treasures
are locked up, and it is left to patience and ingenuity
to open the several doors. Caoutchouc and gutta
percha have always been elastic and extensible; but
it is only of late that their properties have been ascertained
and turned to profitable account. The
cinchonas had grown for five thousand years in Peru
before the Jesuit missionaries discovered the tonic
influence which the bark exerts on the human system.
Steam was always capable of condensation,
so as to leave in its place a vacuum; but it is only a
century and a half since it struck the Marquis of
Worcester to employ this circumstance as a motive
power. And ever since our earthly ball was fashioned,
electricity has been able to sweep round it at
the rate of ten times each second, though it is only
within the last few years that Professor Wheatstone
thought of sending tidings on its wings. And doubtless
the cabinets still unlocked contain secrets as
wonderful and as profitable as these; whilst the language
of Providence is, “Be diligent, and be at peace
among yourselves, and the doors which have defied
the spell of the sorcerer and the battle-axe of the
warrior will open to the prayer of harmonious industry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So thoroughly provided with all needful commodities
is the great house of the world, that, in order
to obtain whatever we desiderate, seldom is aught
else requisite than a distinct realization of our want
and a determined effort to supply it. In working
mines, one of the difficulties with which the excavator
has to contend is the influx of water. The effort
to remedy this evil gave birth to the steam-engine;
and, with the relief afforded by the steam-pump,
many mines are easily and profitably wrought which
otherwise must have long since become mere water-holes.
But a worse enemy than water encounters
the collier, in the shape of fire-damp, or inflammable
gas. Formerly, in quarrying his subterranean gallery,
the axe of the unsuspecting pitman would pierce
a magazine of this combustible air, and unlike
water, there being nothing to bewray its presence, it
filled the galleries with its invisible serpent-coils;
and it was not till a candle approached that it revealed
itself in a shattering explosion, and a wretched
multitude lay burning and bleeding along its track—a
fearful hecatomb to this fiery dragon. What was
to be done? Were the blast furnaces of Wales and
Wolverhampton to be extinguished, and were household
fires to go out? Or, for the sake of a blazing
ingle and good cutlery, were brave men still to be
sacrificed to this Moloch of the mine? The question
was put to Science, and Science set to work to solve
it. Many good expedients were suggested, but the
most ingenious was in practice the simplest and
safest. It was ascertained that a red heat, if unaccompanied
by flame, will not ignite the fire-damp;
and it was also known, that the most powerful flame
will not pass through wire-gauze, if the openings
are sufficiently small. A lamp or a candle might,
therefore, be put into a lantern of this gauze, and
then plunged into an atmosphere of inflammable air;
and whilst the flame inside the lantern gave light
enough to guide the laborer, none of that flame
could come through to act as a match of mischief.
And now, like a diver in his pneumatic helmet, the
miner, with his “Davy,” can traverse in security,
the depths of an inflammable ocean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So plentiful is the provision for our wants, that
little more is needed than a distinct statement in
order to secure a supply. During his long contest
with England, and when both the ocean and the
sugar-growing islands were in the power of his enemy,
Napoleon said to his <span class='it'>savans</span>, “Make sugar for
the French out of something which grows in
France.” And, like Archimedes with the tyrant’s
crown, they set to work on the problem. They
knew that sugar is not confined to the Indian cane.
They knew that it can be obtained from many
things—from maple, and parsnips, and rags; but the
difficulty was to obtain it in sufficient quantities, and
by an inexpensive process. However, knowing the
compartment in which the treasure was concealed,
they soon found the key; and it was not long till
beet-root sugar was manufactured in thousands of
tons, nearly as good, though not nearly so cheap, as
the produce of England’s colonies. A few years
ago the British Foreign Office had a dispute with the
Neapolitan Government. The best sulphur is found
in Sicily, and from that island Great Britain imports
for its own manufactures about 20,000 tons a year.
On the occasion referred to, the Neapolitan Government
was about to complete an arrangement which
would have enormously enhanced the price of this
important commodity. Some wished that England
should make it a <span class='it'>casus belli</span>, and send her ships of
war to fetch away the brimstone by force. But
the chemists of England took the quarrel into their
own hands; and, had not the King of Naples
yielded, doubtless we should now have been supplied
with sulphur from sources at command but
yet undeveloped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A modification of the same problem is constantly
occurring to practical science, and its almost uniform
solution shows that our world has been arranged
with a benevolent eye to the growing comfort of the
greater number. Science is perpetually importuned
to cheapen commodities; and by substituting a simple
method for an intricate process, or by making a
common material fulfill the part of a rare one, it is
every year giving presents to the poor. Few substances
are more essential to our daily comfort than
soda. It is a large constituent of glass and soap, and
many other useful articles. The cleanliness of a nation
depends on the cheapness of soda; and if soda is
cheap, you can substitute plate-glass for crown in
your windows, and you can adorn your apartments
with glazed pictures and mirrors. So that from the
bleacher who spends thousands-a-year on the carbonate,
to the apprentice who in the dog-days lays out a
penny on ginger-beer or soda-water, all are interested
in the cheapness of soda. But this alkali used to be
dear. Small quantities were found native, and larger
supplies were obtained from the burning of sea-weed.
Still the cost was considerable. However, it was
well known that a vast magazine of the precious article
surrounds us on every side. The sea is water
changed to brine by a salt of soda. If only a plan
could be contrived for separating this soda from the
hydro-chloric acid, which makes it common salt,
there is at our doors a depot large enough to form a
Mont Blanc of pure soda. That plan was discovered;
and now a laundress buys a pound of soda (the carbonate)
for three half-pence, and the baker of unfermented
bread can procure the more costly bicarbonate
for sixpence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lately, if not still, in the shops of provincial apothecaries,
no article was in such demand as one styled
in the Pharmacopœia, muriate of magnesia. This
popular medicine was first obtained by evaporation
from certain mineral waters, and as the supply was
limited the price was high. But few ingredients
could be cheaper than the earth and the acid from
which it is combined. The earth forms whole
mountains, and the acid is that cheap one set free
when the soda is separated from common salt. Accordingly,
chemists went to work, and in their laboratories
did what the mineral spring had been doing
since the Deluge, and by a simple process they manufactured
the muriate of magnesia. A few years
ago, looking at the remarkable rocks of magnesian
limestone which defend the Durham coast, near
Shields, our companion remarked, “Many a hundred
tons of these rocks have we converted into Epsom
salts!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Waste not, want not.” An adage which received
a touching sanction when, after a miraculous feast,
and when He could have converted the whole region
into bread, the Saviour said, “Gather up the fragments,
that nothing be lost.” And in the progress
of discovery, God is constantly teaching us not to
waste anything, for this is a world of which nothing
need be lost. At the woollen factories of Rheims
there used to accumulate a refuse, which “it cost
something to throw away.” This was the soap-water
containing the fatty matters washed from the
woollen stuffs, along with some soda and other ingredients.
With its offensive scum this soap-water
was a nuisance, and required to be put out of the
way with all convenient speed. But now, from one
portion of it gas is manufactured, sufficient to supply
all the works, and the remainder yields a useful
soap.<a id='r8'/><a href='#f8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a> In the same way, when Lord Kaims found
himself proprietor of an extensive peat-moss in the
neighborhood of Stirling, with characteristic energy
he commenced its improvement. On digging through
the moss, he came to a rich alluvial soil; so that to
his sanguine imagination, fifteen hundred acres, at
whose barrenness his neighbors laughed, were a
splendid estate, covered over meanwhile by a carpet
seven feet thick. To lift this carpet was the puzzle:
for every acre of it weighed some hundred tons.
But “the mother of invention” is the near kinswoman
of most Highland lairds, and “necessity” suggested
a plan to Lord Kaims: a plan which must
have approved itself to the mind of a judge, for, by a
sort of retributive process, it forced the element
which had done the damage to undo it again. By a
hydraulic contrivance, a powerful current of water
was made to traverse the moss and carry off the
loosened fragments, till they reached the river Forth,
and were finally floated into the German Ocean.
And now “a waste,” which last century was the
haunt of the curlew, is covered with heavy crops,
and yields its proprietor a revenue of two or three
thousand pounds a year. But had Lord Kaims foreseen
Mr. Reece’s researches into the composition
and capabilities of “bog-earth,” he would, perhaps,
have hesitated before he consigned such a treasure to
the deep. At this moment we are writing by the
light of a candle which last year was a peat! And,
however opinion may differ as to the probable expense
of the process, there can be no doubt that peat yields
in large quantities the ammonia which is so largely
used by farmers; the acetic and pyroligneous acids,
extensively employed by calico-printers, hatters, etc.;
and, along with naptha, a fatty substance capable of
being converted into beautiful candles; so that Mr.
Owen’s benevolent calculation will, doubtless, sooner
or later be fulfilled, and “Irish moss” become a cure
for Irish misery.<a id='r9'/><a href='#f9' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[9]</span></sup></a> It is pleasant to know that on
every side we are surrounded with mines of unexamined
wealth. Some of the old workings may be
exhausted; but if we be only devout and diligent
new veins will open. Forty years ago, so much oil
was required for lighting the streets of cities as well
as for private dwellings, that fears began to be entertained
lest the great oil-flask of the Northern Ocean
might run dry, and the whale family be extirpated.
That fear was superseded when, in 1812, gas illumination
was introduced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The best of things is water.” So sang a very
ancient Greek; and of all the fragments preserved in
Aristotle’s “Rhetoric,” hydropathy and teetotalism
have assigned the palm to this old water-poem. Not
so our ship-owners. To them the sorest of problems
and the saddest of expenses is water. Soup can be
inspissated into osmazome, and meat can be squeezed
into pemican; but water is not compressible, and it
is rather provoking to see the space available for
stowage occupied by tanks and barrels of this cheap
element. Many expedients have been suggested,
and some have partially succeeded. But since we
began to write this paper, our attention has been
called to a beautiful contrivance which promises to
conquer every difficulty. By means of Mr. Grant’s
Distilling Galley,<a id='r10'/><a href='#f10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[10]</span></sup></a> the brine may be pumped up from
the ocean, and, after cooking the mess of the largest
ship’s company, it may be collected in the form of
the purest fresh water, to the extent of some hundred
gallons each day. Nor is it only a vast saving of
room which is effected by this beautiful expedient.
It is a saving of time. Frequently ships are compelled
to leave the straight route, and sometimes lose a
favoring wind, in quest of water. But a ship provided
with this apparatus is as independent as if she
were sailing over a fresh water lake; and, instead of
putting into port, she has only to resort to the never-failing
pump. And we may add that it is not only
space and time which are saved, but the health of the
crew and the passengers. With every precaution cistern-water
is apt to spoil, and in the Indian Seas and
other regions the water obtained on shore is apt to
occasion disease. But the produce of this engine is
always as pure as the rain which falls from the
clouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Pythagoras demonstrated the geometrical
proposition, that in a rectangular triangle the sum of
the two lateral squares is equal to the square of the
hypotenuse, he is said to have offered the sacrifice
of a hundred oxen. In modern art we fear that there
are many discoveries for which the thank-offering
has not yet been rendered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both the reader and the writer are deeply indebted
to that gracious Providence which has cast our lot in
the most favored of all times. Chiefly through the
progress of the Arts, the average of existence has
been lengthened many years, and into these years it
is possible to concentrate an amount of literary acquisition,
and moral achievement, and intellectual enjoyment,
for which Methuselah himself had not leisure.
For lives thus lengthened let us show our gratitude
by living to good purpose; and, remembering that
railways and telegraphs and steam-printed books are
the good gifts of God, let the age which enjoys them
be also the age of holiest obedience and largest benevolence.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>One</span> day after one of the youth’s little visits to the
terrace, Captain and Mrs. Stimpson were sitting at
the door enjoying the afternoon breeze which came
fresh from the ocean, and watching the craft in the
harbor, when Judith came skipping up to the door,
with a great red rose in her hand. Her father accosted
her:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Judy, my gal, where have you been? Sir’s
flower! Come, light old daddy’s pipe for him, and
tell what that youngster has been talking about so
long at the gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I will, sir,” (jumping on her father’s knee, and
putting the rose in his button-hole,) “if you will please
call me Judith, and not keep calling yourself old
daddy. You are not old, I am sure. He always
says pa, or my father, and it sounds so much prettier—don’t
it, ma?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He! who’s he?” chuckled the delighted father,
winking to his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, didn’t you say George Fayerweather,
sir?” asked Judith, stroking his chin. “He often
asks me why I don’t call you two, pa and ma.
Now, wont you promise not to laugh at me if I call
you so sometimes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may call me what you please, if you don’t
call me too late to dinner,” said her father. “But
you don’t tell your old dad—father, I mean—what
you’ve been talking about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, he says,” she replied in a tremulous voice,
her rosy lip quivering, “he’s going to sea soon, to
be gone a year; and he says”—her eyes brightening—“that
he means to bring you home the handsomest
pipe he can find up the Straits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank the lad, I thank him,” said the captain,
with his usual sonorous h-m-gh; “that youngster’s a
smart chap.” Turning to his wife—“Mind what I
say, he’ll turn out something remarkable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he is going to bring you, mother, a beautiful
tortoise shell snuff-box.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is he going to bring you, my darling?”
said her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told him I would not have any thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what did he say to you, dear?” asked her
mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here comes old Mary to call us to tea,” said
Judith, glad to dispose of the interrogatory in so propitious
a manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could you have seen Captain Stimpson at his well-furnished
board, you would have been at no loss to
account for his rotundity. Judith presided, with her
father and mother on the side at her left hand, old
grandsir Stimpson, in his arm-chair, at her right,
and Mr. Solomon Tarbox, the foreman of the rope-walk,
on the fourth side, opposite to her. A small,
japanned tea-tray was placed before her, upon which
were ranged the tea-cups of burnt china, about the
size of egg-shells, with saucers to match, a silver
sugar-dish and cream-pitcher, but little larger than
those which would grace a child’s baby-house at the
present day, and two shining black tea-pots, each
holding about a pint, one filled with the best bohea
and the other with boiling water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pewter tankard, filled with small-beer of Mrs.
Stimpson’s own brewing, was placed at her husband’s
right hand; it being a beverage of which he
was fond, not being able to bring himself to like the
new-fangled wishy-washy stuff called tea. Before
grandsir was placed a small mug of peppermint-tea,
which the old gentleman thought more healthful. A
lobster in his scarlet suit occupied the centre of the
table; flanked on one side by a parallelogram of
smoked salmon, six inches by seven; on the other
by a dish of cold baked beans. A plate of white
bread and another of brown, half an oblate spheroid
of butter, and a truncated cone of Dutch cheese
found a place on the table; and to crown all, a dish
of miracles, a kind of cake much in vogue in those
days, and not differing materially from the crullers
of New York, being the same, under a different
name, with the Massachusetts dough-nuts of more
modern date, excepting that the dough was formed
into grotesque figures, displaying the fancy of the
compounder to great advantage. In this article
Judith particularly excelled, few possessing either
her taste or fancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old grandsir, in his white linen cap, pushed
a little back from his furrowed brow, with clasped
hands, and in a tremulous voice, asked a blessing; to
which his son responded with an audible amen, followed
by his usual h-m-gh. Judith commenced the
operation of pouring out the tea, first ascertaining
that her grandfather’s peppermint was to his taste,
and being commended by him for having his little
slip of salt fish broiled to a nicety; for notwithstanding
the usual abundance of his son’s table, the good
man always chose to have something prepared exclusively
for himself. Judith handed the tea with a
natural grace, equaling any elegance acquired at a
modern boarding-school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father, after seeing that all were well supplied
with the good things on his table, took up his pewter
tankard, and with a respectful nod to the old gentleman
said, “Father, my sarvice to you; Miss Stimpson,
my sarvice; sarvice, sarvice,” nodding to Judith
and Mr. Tarbox; then applying the vessel to his lips,
he took a long and apparently a very refreshing
draught. Judith, though a beauty and a heroine,
despised not the vulgar enjoyments of eating and
drinking, but valued them as social pleasures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After ample justice being done to the meal by all
parties, Captain Stimpson and Mr. Tarbox went off
to the rope-walk. Grandsir, removing his chair to a
window, where the afternoon breeze blew in refreshingly,
and placing his Bible, his favorite companion,
on his knees, was soon in a gentle slumber;
his head thrown back on his comfortable chair, and
his hands folded on the pages of the sacred volume
before him, opened at his favorite last of Revelations.
Mrs. Stimpson, taking up her knitting-work, sat herself
down by the side of the table, to superintend the
clearing away of the tea-things. She followed Judith
with her fond eyes, as the little maiden tripped
lightly about in her neat, speckled apron, putting
every thing in its place in the most housewifely
manner, and directing old Mary in an affectionate
and cheerful tone of voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put away the tea-things in their accustomed
places, in the little buffet with glass-doors, at the
corner of the room, in which three mandarins of
china were conspicuous, one on the middle projection
of each shelf: then seating herself down at the window,
she began to ply her needle in the embroidering
of various figures in fine cat-gut to imitate lace;
a kind of ladies’ work as much in vogue in those
days as the worsted and crochet-work has been in
our day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Stimpson soon joined them with his pipe,
but their conversation was interrupted by a gentle
rap at the tea-room door, and on the captain’s opening
it, George Fayerweather appeared, with a lame
excuse for so soon repeating his visit. He was cordially
received by the captain, who invited him to
sit down, which he immediately did, in such a manner
as to occupy the whole width of a window in
the front parlor, to which the family now all adjourned;
grandsir rousing and going with them, as
he loved to doze by the sound of his children’s
voices. The evening being fairly set in, a light was
brought by old Mary; but being placed in a little
cupboard, the door of which was nearly closed, the
rest of the room was left in obscurity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little party remained for some time almost in
silence; the coolness of the hour, after the heat of the
day, bringing to each a sense of tranquil enjoyment,
which none felt disposed to interrupt by conversation.
It is in such moments, that throwing off the
cares of life, and forgetting its sorrows and disappointments,
in the presence of those best loved, one
feels possessed of a treasure of happiness—though
the hoard maybe small—which wholly fills the mind
and satisfies the wishes. “The heart” does not
“distrustful ask if this be joy,” secure in the sober
certainty. These are the moments, which, in their
flight, mark their traces most deeply in the memory,
over which we brood as a miser over his gold, and
which, when past never to return, leave the heart
most desolate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beauty of the evening drew many from their
dwellings to enjoy it in the open air, and others whom
thrift or need forbade to suspend longer their occupations,
resumed them with fresh vigor—a murmur
of voices, mingled with other sounds of busy life,
softened and blended by distance, found its way into
the open windows of the apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At intervals, a faint and distant strain of music was
heard, at first scarcely perceptible, and which each
one might have attributed to imagination as it occasioned
no remark; but on the breeze freshening the
sounds drew nearer, and at length a strange and beautiful
melody was poured forth, melancholy though
delicious, which drew an exclamation of surprise and
delight from the whole party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what is it!” exclaimed Judith; “what can
it be, and where does it come from?” as a sensation
almost amounting to superstition stole over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds,” said the father, “almost like the
music which I’ve heard many a time, when I was
before the mast, from some of the big churches in
foreign parts, as it came over the water, whilst I kept
watch on deck of a moonlight night, when the vessel
was near port.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the old gentleman arousing, cried out, “I’ve
been asleep, I declare—what a beautiful dream I’ve
had. I dreamed I was in the New Jerusalem, and
was walking by the side of the river, where was the
Tree of Life, with twelve manner of fruits hanging
from its branches. I heard the angels with their
golden harps—though somehow I couldn’t see them—why,
there it is again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here a swell of wild harmony filled the room,
prolonged and varied for a moment, and dying away
in a low wail. Judith felt her eyes fill with tears as
the strain ceased, and looking in the direction where
George was sitting, exclaimed, “Oh, it comes from
that window! I know it does! I thought so all
the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>George now spoke—“Well, come let us see if we
can find it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On her approach, as he sought her hand to draw
her to the window, she drew back, saying she must
get the light; on bringing which, a long, slender box
of polished wood was discovered, filling the space in
the window, which was opened just wide enough to
admit it. The sounds were now found to proceed
from strings stretched across its upper surface,
(which was carved and gilded,) and fastened at each
end by pegs of ivory and brass. The delighted girl
asked in wonder—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it? Where did it come from? Whose
is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The latter of which interrogatories George answered
by pointing to her name carved at full length
at one end, his own initials, in very small characters,
appearing beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is an Eolian harp,” he said, “it is played
upon by the winds, and is a little conjuror—if you
should happen to have an acquaintance at sea”—here
he looked full in her blushing face with an expression
of much feeling, his voice slightly trembling—“and
should care to know any thing how he
fared, put the harp in the window, and the winds
will waft the intelligence across the ocean, and as
the strains are in harmony or in discord you may
judge of his welfare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She replied—“Oh, how much I thank you for it.
But I am sure I should not forget you without it—oh,
I am sure I should not,” she added, in a lower
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then seized her scissors, which hung at her side
by its silver chain, and looking into her face for permission,
separated a silken ringlet from her head,
and, folding it carefully, placed it in his bosom, then,
the evening being somewhat advanced, he took his
leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the point of George’s going to sea was first
settled, his mother’s lamentations were loud and
deep; but at length, when the voyage was engaged,
and the time drew near for his departure, as was
usual with her when an evil was unavoidable, she
bore it as well as any one could, and busied herself
with alacrity in his equipments. She made great
complaints that he could be allowed but one sea-chest;
in which, however, she managed to find room
for two plum-puddings, half a dozen minced pies,
and a roast-turkey, that he might at least keep
Thanksgiving, which was near at hand, if not Christmas,
on board the vessel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the day before he was to sail, a new idea
seemed to strike her. She called Mrs. Wendell,
who was present and assisting, as usual, when any
thing extraordinary was going on in her aunt’s
family; and they both went again to the chest. It
had been packed and repacked six times already;
but with Amy’s assistance, a closely-folded pile of
sea-clothes was once more taken out, and by still
closer packing, and a different arrangement, room
was made for an oblong pasteboard box. She then
went to the high chest of drawers of black mahogany,
which stood in frowning majesty in her chamber,
and was taking out an article laid with great
care in one of the drawers, when her husband, who
had thought all was finished, entered to see what
more she had found to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“High! high! what are you doing with my best
cravat with the Brussels lace?” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“La, Mr. Fayerweather, my dear, you know you
never wear it only on great occasions—such as a
wedding or so; and there is nobody to be married
now, before George comes home. I am going to let
him have it, for there’s no time to send to Boston
for any; and if any thing should happen, you shall
have my best set of lace, which is handsomer
than this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know that; but what upon earth can
George do with a Brussels’ laced cravat at sea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear, when he’s in London, you know,
he may be invited to dine with the king; and I
should want to have him dressed suitably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To dine with the king!” cried Mr. Fayerweather,
shouting with laughter; “what could have put such
an idea into your head?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madam was quite offended, and said with great
dignity, “Phillis Wheatly drank tea with the queen
and I am sure, I do not see why our son may not
be invited to dine with the king.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, my dear, I ask your pardon; let
George have the cravat, by all means; and you had
better let him have my blue-satin waistcoat, laced
with silver, to wear also, when he dines with his
majesty,” said Mr. Fayerweather, turning away to
hide a good-natured smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I was thinking of that, but we can’t find
room for it in the chest; and I suppose he may find
one ready made in London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This weighty affair settled, and the chest packed
again for the seventh and last time, it was locked to
go on board the vessel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning came, the wind was fair, and the
young sailor took his way to the wharf. “Good-bye,
Cousin Amie!” he cried, to Mrs. Wendell, who
was waiting at her door to shake hands with him;
“when I go up the Straits, I’ll get you the handsomest
brocade that was ever seen in Salem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few weeks after George’s departure, which
time passed gloomily away with his family, Madam
Brinley, a sister of Mrs. Fayerweather, came to
Salem, and moved into the large house, opposite the
Fayerweather mansion, which was a joyful event to
Madam. The two sisters bore a strong resemblance
to each other in features, with some shades of difference
in character. Madam Brinley was a few
years the elder; her nose might have been a little
more pointed, and, perhaps, her temper rather
sharper; then she was more worldly, and took more
state upon herself. She was a widow of about ten
years standing, with a handsome estate. Having
lost several children in infancy, she had remaining
only two daughters. Molly, the then fashionable
cognomen for Mary, was then just fifteen, and
Lizzy, two years younger. The three families residing
so near together, made the winter a more
pleasant one to the little neighborhood—George’s
absence furnishing a subject of joyful anticipation in
his return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early the next spring an important personage
made his appearance in Paved Street—no less than
a son to Mr. Wendell. He was, as is generally the
case with the first, the wonder of the age. Madam
Fayerweather declared, “He was the beautifullest
baby that ever was seen.” Madam Brinley said, “It
was certainly a remarkably fine infant;” while Mr.
Fayerweather declared it was the exact counterpart
of all the babies he ever saw. I am sorry to say
that Mr. Wendell did not comport himself with all
the dignity to be expected from his new character;
for he only laughed as if he would kill himself,
whenever his son was presented to him; but could
not be prevailed upon by any means, to take it into
his arms, for fear of its falling to pieces; to the great
scandal of the little wizened old woman from Marblehead,
in whose lap it usually lay, its long robes
touching the floor; she averred, “It was a sin and
a shame that its sir wouldn’t take to it more, when
it was as much like him as two peas in a pod—it
was the most knowinist and the most remarkablest
baby ever she seed in her baarn days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the young gentleman was in its fourth week,
his mother, according to custom, received visitors
in her chamber. In these visits, scarcely less state
was observed than in those to the bride; but matrons
and elderly ladies were alone privileged to
make them. If any young damsel had the hardihood
to make her appearance within the sacred precincts,
though under shelter of her mother’s wing, she was
immediately pronounced as cut out for an old maid—and
the oracle seldom failed of fulfillment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first day on which Mrs. Wendell sat up for
company, when she was just attired in a handsome
undress, made expressly for the occasion, and was
seated in state in her easy chair, while nurse was
preparing the baby to display him to the best advantage,
Scipio thrust in his black head at the door with
a “He! ho! he! Missy Amy, Scip’ got suthen for
de picaninny.” Here Madam Fayerweather’s voice
was heard reproving him for going before her, when
the door was thrown open, and in she came with
Scipio after her, bearing a beautiful wicker cradle,
lined with white satin. Madam unfolded the cradle-quilt
with great pomp and circumstance; and now
the grand secret came out—Amy’s wondering eyes
beheld the great work—the very work! which had
employed all her aunt’s moments of leisure for upward
of three years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was composed of pieces of silk of every pattern
that had been worn in the family for two generations,
and cut into every form which Madam’s imagination
could devise, or her scissors shape. There
were squares, triangles, and hexagons; there were
stripes perpendicular, horizontal, and diagonal, with
stars, double and single; of brocade, watered tabby,
paduasoy, damask, satin, and velvet; in short, it
was a very grand affair. After having sufficiently
enjoyed her niece’s surprise and pleasure, the happy
and triumphant aunt took her grand-nephew from
his nurse, and laid him on his new couch, then
placed the quilt over him, turned down at the
head, to display the lining of pink sarsnet; and being
quite satisfied with the additional splendor which
the <span class='it'>tout ensemble</span> gave to the apartment, she took
the baby up again, (he was fortunately a very quiet
one,) and put him into the lap of his nurse, until
visitors should be heard coming, when he was to be
reinstated in all the magnificence of his luxurious
cradle. He was christened the next Sunday at
church. Mr. Fayerweather having consented to stand
as one of the godfathers, Madam, feeling some qualms
of conscience, sent to Boston privately for a very
rich lace, to replace the one which she had abstracted
for George.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The succeeding summer they received two letters
from George; both written in high spirits, and discovering
a degree of intelligence and good sense
which highly gratified his father. That same season,
John, the younger son, entered college. Being of
bright parts and fond of study, he bade fair to realize
all the expectations his father had formed for his
brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dark November came again, with its naked trees
and sad-colored skies. This gloomy month, in
which the inhabitants of <span class='it'>old</span> England are said to
be most prone to hang themselves, the Puritan
fathers of New England, with greater wisdom, enlivened
by the only festival they ever instituted—Thanksgiving.
On this occasion, after offering up
solemn thanks in public to the bountiful Hand,
“who had crowned the year with his goodness,”
with all the scattered branches of their families
gathered under the patriarchal roof, they indulged in
Thanksgiving-dinner—the only approach they ever
made to merry-making—an abundant feast of every
good thing the seasons had afforded; imparting to
the poor a liberal portion. It is to be regretted,
that abuses, in time, crept in, in the train of this—it
might otherwise be truly called—sacred festival—that
cruel sports became connected with its celebration,
which have since continued almost to form a
part of it. It is like associating the bloody rites of
paganism with our most pure and holy worship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the Thanksgiving of this year, a family-party
was collected at Mr. Fayerweather’s, with the addition
of the Episcopal clergyman, Mr. McGregor,
the family physician, Dr. Holly, and one or two
other friends. In the evening, the accustomed game
of Blind Man’s Buff was called for, in which no
one was privileged to refuse joining. George’s absence
was now loudly lamented, but he was not expected
until Christmas. Much merriment and noise,
however, succeeded. The good clergyman, an Oxford
scholar, and a deep and sound divine, who
always went into company ready prepared with a
particular subject to debate upon, with all his
weapons sharpened for the contest; and who had at
length succeeded in engaging Mr. Wendell in a grave
discussion on some knotty point in divinity, was obliged
to break off, just as he had established the premises
to an important conclusion. He joined in the
“mad game” with a very bad grace, but by degrees,
warming with the sport, he enjoyed it the most of
the party, and shouted the loudest when Mr. Fayerweather,
on being caught by Lizzy Brinley, left his
wig in her hand, and escaped with his bare poll.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Holly, who loved sport better than his life, on
being caught and blindfolded, managed, by a little
cheating, to catch Madam Fayerweather, to her
unfeigned astonishment. At this juncture, Flora
tripped lightly into the room, and whispered to her
master, who immediately followed her out, when
Vi’let, in a flaming red gown, popped in her head
for a moment with a most remarkable expression of
countenance. As she closed the door softly, she gave
a significant nod to the company, to let them know
she was in possession of a great secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fayerweather a moment after returned, bringing
in with him a tall stranger, and made signs to
the company to take no notice of the interruption.
All passed so silently that Madam did not perceive
either the going out or the returning, but continued
to sail round the room in her green damask, without
being able to catch any one. At length her husband
thrust the tall stranger in her way, whom she caught
amidst shouts of laughter, succeeded by deep silence,
while she was naming him. All eyes were fixed
on the stranger with different expressions, which
we will not attempt to describe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madam cried out, “Well, I’ve caught somebody
at last!—who upon earth is it! John, it’s you, I
know; you are standing on something to deceive
me, you saucy boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here she felt the clustering curls of the stranger’s
head—John’s hair was straight, and all the other
masculine heads in company wore peruques—when
reminiscences of earlier <a id='day'></a>days seemed suddenly to
strike her, and she threw off her blinder, bringing
with it fly-cap and lappets, and exclaiming with a
shriek—“Can it be George!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>George, indeed, it was; standing six feet one
inch in his shoes. We would describe, if we could,
what is indescribable, but which may easily be
imagined—the exclamations—the shakes of the hand—the
congratulations which followed. After the
parents of the newly arrived son had sufficiently admired
him, and had expended their stock of wondering
expressions at his growth, the rest of the
party took their turn, inwardly deciding in their own
minds that he was the finest looking fellow they
had ever seen. He was, in truth, a noble specimen
of manhood; but his curling hair, the overflowing
and almost child-like good-humor—the fun, which
shone in his full blue eye, and extended his somewhat
large mouth and full lips, displaying his
brilliantly white teeth, seemed to bespeak him
still the boy, despite his giant frame, and the brown
tinge which darkened his cheek. The salutations
over, the company very considerately took their
leave, excepting George’s relatives, who lingered
a few moments after the rest to welcome him home
again, and to bid him more affectionate adieus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During breakfast, next morning, the young mariner
related his adventures, and the wonders he had beheld
in foreign parts; from the first whale he saw,
which awoke out of a comfortable afternoon’s
nap, just after they had passed “the Banks,” and
which, lazily yawning, opened its huge jaws and
then closed them again, spouting water as high as
the top-gallant mast, to Stromboli, spouting fire for
the express entertainment of sailors on a dark night,
as they neared the coast of Sicily. Not omitting the
Tower of London, where he had held his head in the
lion’s mouth for full five minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You naughty, wicked boy!” exclaimed his mother,
almost breathless with terror; “I really believe
I should have been tempted to box your ears. Did
you ever hear any thing like it, Amy?” The latter
during the recital having quietly slipped in, and taken
her seat at the table. “Mr. Wendell being obliged
to go away by daylight, and the baby not having yet
awakened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>George made no reply, but continued his narrative,
eating lump after lump of sugar out of the basin, and
escaping the rap over the knuckles, which he would
once have had. Then the Cross of St. Paul’s—on
the right arm of which he had stood upon one leg,
whilst Dick did the same on the left, shaking hands
together over the top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John, who had been listening in silent wonder and
delight, at this climax clapped his brother on the
shoulder in an ecstasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a pity you hadn’t both broken your necks,”
exclaimed Mrs. Wendell, in indignation. “What
upon earth did you play such pranks for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fayerweather wore his comical look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, now, cousin—when I’ve brought you
home such a beautiful gown—a rich yellow calamanco,
the brightest there was in the shop. Dick
went with me on purpose to help me choose it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s the brocade you promised me, you
scapegrace?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I’m sorry, but I forgot all about it until I
came back to London; but I thought being an old
married woman now, a nice calamanco would do as
well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This turn in the conversation changed the current
of his mother’s thoughts, and she wished to see the
rarities he had brought home. In her impatience,
before her husband had half-finished his second cup
of coffee, she ordered—I am wrong. The perogative
of ordering the servants in this family, Vi’let allowed
to none but herself—she desired Scipio to
bring in the ponderous sea-chest, the weight of
which was a sufficient excuse for the appearance of
the other three, each bearing a corner. Aunt Vi’let
indulgently making allowances for the curiosity of
Flora and Peter, and telling them, patronizingly, “to
bear a hand.” Madam and her niece, full of eager
expectation, seated themselves on the floor beside the
chest, both ready to dive into its deepest recesses,
the moment it should be opened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first thing which presented itself to view, was
a red worsted cap with a famous red tassel. This
George threw to Scipio, telling him, it was for him.
It was received with a grin from ear to ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tank you, massa, now Scip got suthen to put on
his head nex ’lection. Primus shan’t be king no
longer. Scip king heself! He! he! he!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others withdrew, they having too much of
the pride of the family to be willing to have it supposed
they were expecting there was any thing for
them. Scipio not being able to restrain his impatience
to try on his new finery, pulled it on as he
went into the kitchen, exclaiming—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It fits dizackly!” and in his exultation at the favor
shown himself, losing his awe of Vi’let, appealed
to her, without her usual title of respect, “if it
wasn’t mighty becoming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At which, with some indignation, she told him—“He
looked like a black monkey with that red cap
on his head, and that great thing jigging up and down
behind,” betraying some of the infirmity of human
nature, at the preference shown her rival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Wendell now pounced upon a package of
some size, and opening it, cried—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, here’s my yellow calamanco; well, it’s
really a beauty! Nobody could tell it from a rich
satin! I’ll have it made up for Christmas—it’s full
handsome enough, aunt, isn’t it? I’m sure, I am
much obliged to you, George.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop, cousin,” said he, taking it from her, “upon
second thoughts, I cannot let you have that—I remember
now, I bought it for Aunt Vi’let.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Vi’let was called in, the others following in
her wake, and the present unfolded before her admiring
eyes. Her usually grim features were softened
into benignity at the sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That aint for me, Misser George! Well, it is a
parfec’ speck, I ’clare!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could say no more. Her vocabulary, rich in
epithets of vituperation only, was soon exhausted,
when drawn upon for expressions of satisfaction.
Her pleasure was shown in silence. A gay Madras
handkerchief for the head was given to Flora, who
received it with a modest curtsey, and displaying a
row of ivory, and a dimple which many a fairer belle
might have envied. On Peter’s looking rather
solemn at thinking himself forgotten, his young master
told him that his present had not come up from
the vessel yet, he had brought him a fine parrot,
which could talk nearly as well as himself; at which
Peter’s joy knew no bounds. He capered about the
room, regardless where he was, and in whose presence,
until brought to his senses by a smart rap
upon the head by Vi’let, with—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please to walk off into the kitchen, sir, till you
can larn to ’have yeself.” Off went Peter, Vi’let and
Flora following, each with her present tucked under
her arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>George now brought from under a pile of other
things a large roll, carefully wrapped in several
covers. He put it into Mrs. Wendell’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, cousin, I’ve brought you something, but
I’m afraid you will not like it so well as the yellow
calamanco.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Wendell took the roll, and with her aunt’s
assistance removed wrapper after wrapper. When
the last was off, the wrong side of some fabric appeared,
presenting a brown surface, without lustre,
on which were seen rows of floss silk of various gay
colors, lying without any apparent order. The right
side drew an exclamation of admiration from both
aunt and niece, for never had eyes in Salem, beheld
a brocade so magnificent. The figure was a gigantic
crimson peony, and a bunch of cherries alternately,
each with its appropriate green leaves; on a ground
of lustrous chocolate colored satin, firm and thick as
leather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, George!” his cousin exclaimed, “how could
you have brought such a silk for me! I had no idea
you were in earnest—how much it must have cost!
(looking at her uncle.) I really cannot take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! if you do not like it, you can let Mr. Wendell
have it for a <span class='it'>robe de chambre</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it, Amy,” interrupted his father. “I am
glad he has shown so good a taste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” added her aunt, “he has only done just
what we could have wished; remember you are our
only daughter, and Mr. Wendell is like another son
to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy did not attempt to reply, but laid the rich present
aside, carefully. A black case of dog-fish skin of
peculiar form was now brought forth. Mr. Fayerweather
seized upon this, and undoing the little hooks
which served as fastenings, opened it, and displayed
a gold watch with its chain and seals, all richly
chased, luxuriously reposing on crimson velvet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You gave Haliburton my letter then,” he said,
as he took the measure of old Time from its bed, and
examined the whole carefully. Then appearing to
be satisfied with the workmanship, he wound up the
watch, and fastening its large golden hook into the
binding of madam’s apron, it hung at her side, on
its chain, loaded with rich seals, and ticked away
merrily, as if wonderfully refreshed by its long nap,
and in liable to show off with its new mistress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She, finding the costly present really for herself,
expressed her gratification, though with glistening
eyes, in the quiet way which best pleased her husband.
George then rapped his brother over the head
with a silver-mounted flute. His father finding that
all had had their presents, then asked him if he
brought nothing for <span class='it'>him</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have something here, sir, which Mr. Haliburton
said, he thought would be valuable to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All looked in eager expectation, when George diving
with his hand down to the very bottom of the
chest, and bringing up something, which in its egress
turned topsy turvy check-shirts, trowsers, pea-jackets,
etc., etc. It was a stout oaken staff, which he
put into his father’s hand. The latter bore quietly
the merriment which succeeded; though madam
could not forbear expressing some indignation, at
what she took almost as an insult from their old
friend to her husband, who, moving the huge baton
slowly through his fingers, appeared to be examining
closely the grain of the wood for some time in
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haliburton judged right,” at length he said;
“there are few things I should have valued so
much. This staff came from Narley Wood, the old
family estate in Leicestershire, and was cut from an
oak planted by my great grandfather’s own hand.
(He pointed to some letters rudely cut in the wood.)
Wendell shall have my gold-headed cane. I shall
never carry any but this in future.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Wendell was beginning to speak, when a violent
uproar was heard from the precincts of the kitchen,
in which the yelping of a dog and the screams
of a cat predominated. It drew near, and the door
burst open suddenly, when in rushed a large black
and white dog, yelling fearfully, as if in the extremity
of pain and terror, with old tabby on his back, her
tail erect, and looking like the cylindrical brush used
in these latter days to clear stove-pipes, her talons
apparently dug deep into his skin; while Vi’let followed,
belaboring him with a broom-handle. Leaping
over the chest, he made his way to George, on
whose knees he laid his head, whining piteously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Jaco! how did you find your way here?
I left you in the vessel—poor fellow,” said George.
The dog was released from his feline foe by Vi’let,
when she found to whom he belonged. He then
leaped upon his master, with strenuous endeavors
to lick his face, and made other extravagant demonstrations
of joy at finding him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>George then mentioned that he had bought him in
Italy, of a person who kept him to show off in the
celebrated Grotto del cane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had no great curiosity to see the poor devil die
and come to life again, so I tried to beg him off.
His master only laughed, and was forcing him into
the cave by blows, when he seemed to have understood
what I said, for he made out to clear himself,
and came and fawned on me. After this, I could not
help taking him under my protection, so I persuaded
the rascal to sell him to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would have been more like you to have
knocked the fellow down, and taken the dog away in
spite of him,” said his father. “I am glad you have
learned a little prudence. What did you call him?
Jaco.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the name the sailors called him; it is a
corruption they made of his Italian name, Cicco,
meaning blind—he’s blind of one eye. He’s a good
fellow, though no great beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor fellow!” said madam, patting him, “he
must be hungry. John, my dear—do ask Vi’let to
give him something to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John immediately disappeared, and soon returned
bringing in nearly half the contents of Vi’let’s larder,
when all gathered round to see Jaco eat; Mrs. Wendell
for the time forgetting the baby at home. Poor
Jaco, forgetting his first rough reception, thought he
was in Elysium, having doubtless heard of such a
blissful region in the classic land of his nativity, and
in his poor silly brain, not conceiving it could be
appropriated to one species only of created beings,
and that, the remorseless tyrant of all the others. He
stuffed till he could scarcely see out of his remaining
eye; then laying himself down at his master’s feet,
“the sober certainty of waking bliss” was soon lost
in a comfortable nap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a short time, George went out to see some of
his numerous friends. He made a call at his Aunt
Brinley’s, and laughed and jested with his cousins;
he then shaped his course to Neptune street, where
he made so long a stay that dinner had been ready to
put on the table some time before he came home.
Whom he could have gone to see it is not easy to
conjecture; not his friend Dick, for the latter had
called twice to see him during his absence. Where-ever
he might have been, he came home in high good-humor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing his brother, who was watching for him at
the gate, he stooped and took him, passive and unresisting,
on his arm, as a nurse would a child of a
year old, and carried him into the house. Peter was
bringing in dinner as he opened the door, and his mother
had already taken her seat at table. He then
went up to his father, who had not yet risen from
his seat by the fire, slipped softly behind him, and
seizing the chair on which Mr. Fayerweather was
sitting, by the two arms, he said, “By your leave,
sir,” and holding the chair out at arm’s length, he
described with it a semi-circle, himself the centre,
which brought his father directly before the smoking
sirloin. He then stood at his own place at table
while Mr. Fayerweather asked the blessing. The
remainder of the day George passed by the fireside,
making his mother laugh and scold alternately, as he
related the pranks of Dick and himself on board the
vessel, as well as on shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This winter George remained at home, and managed
to pass away the time in making the model of
a fine ship he had seen at Deptford; a little mathematics
with John during the college vacation, but
more skating; and occasionally a sleigh-ride with his
aunt and cousins, with whom he was a great favorite.
Molly had arrived at an age to be admitted to
the assemblies, and was the acknowledged belle of
the season; she, moreover, had made a decided impression
on Sir Harland Hartley, a young baronet
who had arrived in Boston with some dispatches
the previous year, and was visiting Salem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next spring young Fayerweather and his
friend Seaward again set sail. With intervals of a
month or two between, they made several succeeding
voyages together; during one of which, their
vessel was captured by a French privateer, part of
the crew taken out, and a French captain and crew,
nearly double their own remaining number, put on
board. This event gave the two young men the
glorious occasion they had long desired, for displaying
their courage and prowess, which until then
had been wasted or thrown away in feats of strength
or hardihood to excite the wonder of the bystanders.
With their little band they rose upon their captors,
and succeeded in retaking their vessel, which they
carried in triumph to its destined British port. Their
promotion followed of course, and each returned
home master of a fine merchantman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>George’s engagement with Judith Stimpson took
place soon after, naturally occasioning some dissatisfaction
to his family on account of her plebeian
origin; this, however, soon wore off, or was conquered
by the sweetness of the fair young girl, who
soon gained so entirely upon Madam Fayerweather’s
affections, that she declared, “She could not have
loved Judith better if she had been the daughter of
King George himself;” which was saying much,
for madam prided herself on her loyalty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Harland Hartley was now the declared suitor
of Molly Brinley, and great preparations were making
for the wedding. The baronet, being anxious to
return to Quebec as soon as possible, in order to
present his bride to some of his near connections,
who were soon to embark for England, could not
remain in Salem long enough for the three weeks’
sitting up for company. In this dilemma Madam
Brinley concluded, after several long and deep consultations
with her sister and niece, to make a great
wedding, to be followed by a ball and supper, and
to invite all the Salem world, with the court which
was then sitting, and the <span class='it'>élite</span> of Boston.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The preparations for this grand event occupied
the heads and hands of all the female part of the
three families for ten days. Aunt Vi’let being great
in the roasting line, was a very important personage,
and the whole direction of this department
was given to her, she felt her consequence accordingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Molly Brinley was glad to choose a bridemaid
in Judith, whose beauty would contribute to the
<span class='it'>éclat</span> of her wedding; feeling too secure in her own
charms and in Sir Harland’s devotion to her to fear
a rival, and Captain and Mrs. Stimpson were among
the earliest bidden. What was the trepidation of
the latter on her own account in preparing for her
first appearance in the <span class='it'>beau monde</span>. The captain,
determined to spare no expense for his wife and
daughter on so proud an occasion, took a journey to
Boston to make the necessary purchases; his taste,
in dress being unquestioned. The whole family
were up by daybreak to set him off; the expedition
requiring the whole of a long day at that time,
though now the distance is traversed by the rail-cars
in half an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After ransacking every shop in Boston, he bought
for his wife a grass-green damask for a sack, with a
bright-pink lustring for a petticoat; these being the
colors in which she had captivated him, at the
never-to-be-forgotten ordination of Parson Slocum.
It may be well to inform the reader that the sack
was a dress, open before, discovering half the
petticoat, which was usually of the same material.
For Judith he chose better; a delicate buff-colored
satin. This was so much admired that Madam
Brinley sent for some of the same piece for Lizzy,
who was her sister’s other bridemaid. For himself,
the captain bought a full suit of mulberry color, with
a blue-satin waistcoat, magnificently flowered with
red, green and purple; and a new wig, with a bag,
lately come into fashion, he had always worn a tie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the day of the wedding it was thought expedient
to try on their new habiliments to see if they
fitted, and how they all looked together. Mrs.
Stimpson, after surveying herself in the glass before
and behind and on each side, pleased and slightly
agitated at the unwonted elegance of her appearance,
threw herself into a chair and heaving a deep
sigh, to throw off her embarrassment, said to her husband—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh dear! Mr. Stimpson, we must think over a
little what we shall have to do. I suppose, when
we go into the room, Judith must be on your right
hand, and I on your left—no, I must be on your
right hand and Judith on your left—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think, Miss Stimpson,” said the captain, consequentially,
“it will be more becoming for me to go
in first, and for you and Judith to take hold of hands
and follow me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no, Mr. Stimpson; that doesn’t seem to
me to be the right way—it wasn’t so at Nanny
Dennis’s wedding, if I remember me rightly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, ma,” interrupted their daughter gently, “I
do not think this will be exactly like Mrs. Brayton’s
wedding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more it wont,” replied her father, “and we
must go and take pattern by the others; I was always
a good hand at taking a hint, and I don’t doubt we
shall appear as well as any on ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Mrs. Stimpson broke in with—“Oh, Judith,
do think me on’t to make a courtesy when I go in;
like as not I shall forget it in my hurry. I remember
we all courtesied round at Nanny Dennis’s, we
had each of us a white rosy in our hands, and it was
the beautifullest sight! But, where’s my fan? Do
run and get it Judith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judith tripped out of the room to get the fan, and
as she closed the door, grandsir, who was not as
usual dozing, but was listening to their conversation,
and in fact, taking considerable interest in it, spoke
out—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry, my children, to see you are so much
overtaken with the pomps and vanities of this
world; more it seems to me than that young child,
that we might expect it of. You should strive to
have the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, and
remember that pride comes before destruction, and a
haughty spirit before a fall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it does, grandsir,” answered his daughter-in-law
meekly, after a moment of silence; “and I wont
wear this elegant dress, but will put on my brown
paduasoy; that was always thought good enough
for me.” Showing that she had the requisite ornament,
and that the Scripture he quoted was not applicable
to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no child,” he replied quickly; “that would
be disrespectful to your husband. I suppose you
will be expected to have some worthy adornments,
and I must say you become the dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That she does,” added his son, forgetting the old
gentleman’s exordium in his conclusion, “and I
don’t believe there will be a more personable woman
there than Captain Robert Stimpson’s wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mr. Stimpson,” said his wife, with recovered
spirits, “do remember to shut up Trip; if you don’t
he’ll follow us to the wedding; and if I was to see
him in that room I do believe I should be mortified
to pieces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening at length arrived, and the company
assembled in Madam Brinley’s parlor, which was
used on this occasion for the reception-room. This
was a fine room in the fashion of the day, and so
lofty that a reasonably tall man might walk across it
with his hat on, without fear of having it knocked
off by the large beam which crossed the centre of the
ceiling. A rich Turkey carpet, betokening very
high style in those days of sanded floors, formed the
centre-piece of the room. High-backed leather-seated
chairs, thickly studded with brass nails, stood
stiffly against the walls. The fireplace, ornamented
with Dutch tiles, was furnished with andirons of polished
steel; and the shovel and tongs of the same
metal, seemed, as the merry blaze danced on their
bright surfaces, to cast significant glances at each
other across the hearth. A large mantel-glass surmounted
the fireplace, on each side of which hung in
rich black and gold frames, the respective arms of
the Brinley and Borland families, the lady of the
house belonging to the latter. A large pier-glass
hung between the two front windows, in which each
lady might survey her goodly person, and compare
it with that of her neighbor; beneath this was a slab
of gray marble, with highly ornamented iron supporters
fastened into the wall. A tall, oaken desk
and book-case stood in one corner of the room, opposite
to which, a round snap-table of black mahogany,
with claw feet, displayed its disc turned down, of so
remarkable a polish, that little Trip—who, notwithstanding
all his master’s care in shutting him up at
home, had managed to escape from his confinement,
and had followed his mistress into the room unperceived—on
seeing his image so truly reflected, ran
up to it with great glee, sniffing and wagging his
tail, delighted at having found, as he supposed, a
comrade of his own species to bear him out in his
audacity. Mrs. Stimpson turned all manner of colors,
and cast many imploring looks at her husband, who
pretended to be wholly absorbed in the contemplation
of a fire-screen which stood near. On a servant’s
attempting to drive Trip out, he set up a shrill
bark, and ran on his little bow-legs, with his feet
turned out, to his mistress for protection; jumped
into her lap—on her very pink lustring petticoat—and,
putting his black paws on her shoulders, began
whining and licking her face with great affection.
On seeing which, John Fayerweather took his little
four-footed acquaintance in his arms, and put him in
a place of safety; while Captain Stimpson electrified
the company by a more than usually sonorous
h-m-gh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madam Brinley in crimson velvet, and looking
finely, occupied a large arm-chair, curiously carved,
on one side the fireplace. Madam Fayerweather, in
a beautiful white-grounded brocade, and looking as
if she was wishing every body joy, was on her right.
Next to her sat Mrs. Wendell, plainly, though handsomely
dressed. She could boast of but little beauty,
excepting a pair of fine eyes, beaming with intellect
and benevolence; her wit and fine sense, however,
rendered her the centre of attraction at every party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stimpson had the honor of sitting next
Madam Brinley on the left, her husband as near her
as possible, as if for mutual protection. The other
guests stationed themselves with great exactness,
according to their rank and affinity to the hostess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bridal party entered. The bride, a sparkling
brunette, with an exquisite figure, was arrayed in a
sack of white brocade, embroidered with large silver-flowers;
a necklace of oriental pearl encircled her
throat, and pendants of the same hung from her ears.
Her hair combed back from her beautiful forehead,
was turned over a cushion on the top of her head,
where it was confined by a diamond bodkin, falling
from the back of her head in glossy ringlets, whose
jetty hue contrasted finely with her white neck. Altogether
she was as fair a bride as one would wish
to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bridegroom, a handsome man of two and
thirty, appeared to be fully sensible of his importance,
at the same time to be sufficiently enamored
of his bride, and to applaud himself on the taste he
had displayed in his choice. The fair bridemaids
“looked sweetly” in their buff-colored satins, with
aprons of Brussels’ lace, and triple ruffle cuffs of the
same. The groomsmen were Mr. Lindsey, a gay
young Englishman, and George Fayerweather. The
latter, from his stature and noble proportions, was
the most conspicuous figure in the assemblage;
towering over every other by at least three inches.
He was in a coat of light-blue, with under-garments
of white silk. His countenance was an expansion
of all the good-humor and happiness of his mother’s,
with a dash of fun and frolic, under which might be
detected traces of thought and deep feeling. John,
“a pale, intellectual-looking student,” was too reserved
and diffident to become an actor in the scene,
but sat retired, and observed every thing going on in
quiet enjoyment, admiring Judith nearly as much as
his brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The solemn ceremony, which was very impressively
performed by Mr. McGregor, being over and
the cake cut and distributed, arrangements were made
by the master-of-ceremonies, Mr. Wendell, for the
ball. The door being thrown open, the company
were ushered into the dancing-room, brilliantly
lighted up for the occasion. After a short pause, Mr.
Wendell called upon the governor to lead out the
bride for the opening minuet, which was danced in
a very gubernatorial and bridal manner. The bridegroom
and Madam Brinley followed, and then Judge
Wentworth of Boston and Madam Fayerweather,
who was still celebrated for her minuet. Her husband
never danced, and Mr. Wendell then called
out Captain Fayerweather and Miss Stimpson,
though scarcely expecting that Judith would be prevailed
upon to dance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To his surprise, after a little hesitation, with a
smile and a blush, she rose, and as her partner led
her to the head of the room, an involuntary murmur
of admiration ran round the assembly—for never
had a pair appeared of more singular beauty. They
stood side by side, while the accustomed prelude
was played, the blue and white of his habit, contrasting
beautifully with the color of hers, as did
his stately figure with hers of bird-like lightness; she
extended her dress to its greatest width in her delicate
fingers; she cast a timid glance around the room,
he one of manly greeting, her little foot slid to the
right, and she made a low and graceful courtsey,
while his tall figure was bending to the floor in perfect
time to the measure, in this salute to the company.
Then rising slowly, they stood for a moment
with one foot in advance, awaiting the proper signal
from the music, when they turned, and he, with
sparkling eyes, and she, with the delicate bloom
on her cheek heightened to a rose, made a like
lowly reverence to each other. Then, as the pair
became animated with the music, and they floated
round the room, now advancing now receding,
in their magic evolutions crossing and re-crossing,
their graceful forms rising and falling in measured
waves to the time—all their attitudes, and
all their motions of elegance and delicacy combined;
they might have seemed some fair beings of another
sphere, weaving a mystic spell to drive afar all
sorrow. This was the old-fashioned minuet. How
has its place been supplied in the ball-room, by the
waltz and its varieties, the mazurka, the polka, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What were Judith’s father and mother doing all
the while? Entirely forgetting the rest of the company,
and following their daughter with their eyes,
Captain Stimpson, with his lips firmly compressed,
moved his head from side to side in time to the
music, or rather with involuntary imitation of
Judith’s motions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever! Mr. Stimpson,” said his wife,
in an irrepressible ecstasy, as Judith slowly glided
through a peculiarly beautiful part of the figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sartainly never did,” said the captain, drawing
in a very long breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, after all,” rejoined Mrs. Stimpson, “she
has the same solemn eyes of my poor, dear mother;
and it seems to me more so than ever to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look like her grandmother!” said her husband,
with strong emphasis; “she looks more like a bird
of paradise, such as I’ve seen in Ingee. That yaller
satin becomes her most remarkably; she sartainly
is the comeliest person that ever I clapped my
eyes on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Madam Fayerweather joined them, and laying
her hand impressively on the arm of Mrs.
Stimpson, interrupted them as she pointed to Judith,
“She’s the prettiest, the dearest creature that ever
was seen, and as good as she is pretty;” and as the
object of her encomiums came up to them with
glowing cheeks, the minuet being finished, Madam
could not refrain from kissing her, saying, “My
dear, you did dance charmingly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>George would willingly have made one of the
group, but was called away reluctantly by his co-adjutor,
the young Englishman, who asked him with
more freedom than George approved of, “What he
would take for his bargain?” then surveying his
noble figure with internal admiration, he added, after
a short pause, “Fayerweather, you are a lucky
dog.” Afterward, in the course of the evening, he
managed to pay Judith so much attention as to distress
the modest girl not a little, and to give some
pain to George, whose office as groomsman, did not
allow him to be exclusively devoted to her. Mr.
Lindsey manœuvered to be beforehand with every
one else in inviting her to be his partner in the
country dances, and her refusal necessarily obliging
her to sit still, he took his seat by her, and persisted
in keeping it until supper was announced, when he
took her hand, which she had no pretence for refusing,
and led her in triumph to the supper-table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fayerweather, who had intended to perform
this office himself, in order to do particular honor to
his son’s choice, felt no slight displeasure at such
presumption, with a strong disposition to make
known to Mr. Lindsey, that “he considered him an
impertinent coxcomb.” He refrained, however,
and advancing toward Judith’s father and mother,
he begged to have the honor of leading <span class='it'>Madam</span>
Stimpson to the supper-table. Madam Stimpson
bridled up and looked at her husband; the dignified
frown on whose brow was contradicted by the complacent
smile which, in spite of his endeavor, lurked
about his mouth; then making her courtsey—and a
very good one it was—she gave her hand to Mr.
Fayerweather; and the three proceeded in state to
the supper-room—the captain marching with head
erect on the other side of his wife. It was a proud
evening for Captain Bob Stimpson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the whole, the wedding went off with great
<span class='it'>éclat</span>. The happy pair set off the next day for
Boston, to embark for Quebec. On the following
week, Captain Fayerweather was to set sail on a
two years’ voyage—on his return from which he was
to claim his bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the day previous to George’s departure, he
gave his father a cabinet of ebony, curiously inlaid,
and of costly and peculiar workmanship, which a
French prisoner, whose release he had been instrumental
in procuring in one of the British ports, had
prevailed upon him to accept as a token of gratitude
for the service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, my son,” said Mr. Fayerweather,
not a little gratified; “that will be just the thing
for my valuable papers, the little trunk I keep them
in is too crowded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would let me have that, sir, to take
with me; I always took a fancy to it,” rejoined his
son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall have it, and Judith shall have a jewel-box
well filled on her wedding-day, too.” So saying,
Mr. Fayerweather ran down stairs to the counting-room
and quickly returned with the little trunk
in his hand to his own chamber, where he and his
son had been communing. He sat down panting,
and remained a minute or two without speaking,
with his hand on his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, sir, that you are so out of
breath?” his son anxiously inquired; “why didn’t
you let me go for you? I didn’t know what you
left the room for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s nothing but a slight palpitation of the
heart, to which I have been subject a little of late—it
will soon go off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It did not go off, however, and the attack continued
longer than usual; but Mr. Fayerweather
without heeding it, or suffering any indications of it
to appear before his son, proceeded to remove the
papers into their new place of deposit—and George
took the little trunk into his own possession. The
day after Mr. Fayerweather felt more unwell than he
was willing to make known, wishing to spare his
family any additional weight upon their spirits, at
the time of his son’s departure. After this his
attacks became more frequent and of longer duration,
rendering it impossible to conceal them any longer
from Madam, who, in alarm, sent immediately for
Dr. Holly. The latter, upon inquiring into the
symptoms, and examining the pulse of his patient,
looked grave. His prescriptions were successful,
however, and Mr. Fayerweather in a few weeks
appeared to be restored to his usual health.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to return to George; his usual gay spirits deserted
him as he was taking his leave of Judith, and
a depression wholly unknown to him before seized
him, as the boat which was to bear him to the vessel
appeared merrily dancing over the waves to the
wharf, opposite the window near which they were
standing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Farewell, Judith!” said he, then adding playfully,
but with a voice not wholly free from a slight
tremor, “when I return, do not let me find you the
bride of some dashing Englishman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, George! how can you say so?” she replied,
the tears gushing into her eyes; “how can you
think I could ever be the bride of any man but you;
but if there is any truth in dreams, the one I had
last night, tells me I shall never be a bride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, psha upon dreams!” he said, running off to
hide the tears which, in spite of his manliness, were
now streaming down his own cheeks. She saw
him spring into the boat, which she kept in sight
until it reached the vessel. Then going up to her
own room, with a spy-glass she watched the vessel
as it gradually receded from view, until its tallest
mast sunk beneath the waves. She yielded to a
burst of anguish, which she in vain attempted to
control, and sat for some moments sobbing, then
her tears ceased to flow, and her countenance resumed
its wonted serenity; she then went below,
superintended old Mary, and prepared her grandfather’s
supper with more than usual care, her generous
nature not suffering her own private feelings to
interfere with the comfort or happiness of others.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THOS. R. NEWBOLD.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> ever-changing hues of the kaleidoscope, and
the varying tints of our autumnal forests do not present
more changeful or varied scenes than are to be
found in real life in this country. The decay of one
family, the rise of another, depending as they do on
the pecuniary fortunes of their possessors, render
American society a scene of constant excitement,
and he who is at the top of the social ladder to-day,
falls to-morrow with the fall of stocks to the bottom.
The little tale which follows is but a type of what is
daily occurring around us, and is presented as a general
outline, which all may fill up at their leisure to
suit their pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Letitia, or as she was usually called in her girlhood,
Letty Rawdon, was the only daughter of old
Elias Rawdon, a thrifty and prosperous tailor in the
pleasant village of Middlebury. The old man had
married rather late in life, after he had in his own
phrase “got a little something snug about him.”
She followed the usual course of village girls, and at
the dame’s school had learned those difficult arts of
reading, writing, and ciphering. In her young days,
the road to learning was not the plank or rail-road
track on which our young people now travel so readily.
The A, B, C, required some study to ponder
out, and in 179—, the portals to learning were not
thrown so wide open as they are in the year of grace
1852. Be that as it may, Letty, however, mastered
them. From her earliest years she had been an ambitious
child, never content unless she was among
the foremost; as eager for superiority over her little
schoolmates in play as in study, as if she had been
born to rule them. She was not what would be
termed a handsome child, but her features were delicate,
and her full hazel eye looked out from its long
lashes with a glance that showed full well the determined
soul within. She was her father’s darling,
who denied her nothing, whence she soon obtained a
complete ascendancy in the dwelling of the old
tailor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Letty was about thirteen years of age, a
fashionable boarding-school was opened in the village,
and the old man yielded at once to her wishes
to become a day-scholar at it. Here her ambition
carried her rapidly onward, and if Letty, when she
entered it, was comparatively a raw, ignorant country-girl,
no one who saw her at the termination of
her course of studies there, could have recognized in
the graceful, intelligent, and accomplished girl before
him, the little awkward being, who, four years before
had there commenced her career. The principal
of the school, an elegant and accomplished lady,
was early attracted to her by her aptitude for learning,
and her desire to acquire it, and Letty was soon
a favorite pupil. Nor whilst cultivating her mind
did she neglect her person. The elegant manners of
her preceptress made a most decided impression on
her; gradually she found her own forming on the
model before her, and in process of time, though she
made no pretensions to great beauty, it would have
been difficult to have found a more attractive person
than Letty Rawdon, the tailor’s daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young men of the village and neighborhood
were the first to make this discovery, and at all the
general merry-makings which occurred, Letty Rawdon
was, beyond all rivalry, the village belle. We
say general merry-makings, for our village, like all
others large and small, had its aristocracy, and in the
eyes of the “upper circle,” we mean the female part
of it, of its fifteen hundred inhabitants, she was only
“that conceited, forward thing, the daughter of old
Rawdon, the tailor.” Mrs. Baxter, the wife of the
leading lawyer of the place, in an interview with
Mrs. Danforth, the wife of the physician, had settled—“that,
although they supposed in their small place
they must know the tailor’s daughter when they met
her in the street, or at church, or other public place,
still she was not to be on any account admitted into
their set.” How often has many a lovely girl been
thus tabooed, not that she would not confer honor on
them, but she might mayhap be in the way of an advantageous
settlement of some marriageable daughters,
perchance less attractive than herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Letty soon found that there was a determination in
the female magnates of the village to crush her rising
into any importance among them. But the spirit of
the girl rose with the occasion. In a short time it
became generally known that she was to be kept at a
distance by the village fashionables. What cared
she? Her father had accumulated a snug little competency,
and few girls in the neighborhood would be
as well dowered as Letty. On this she was allowed
to draw as she pleased. New and tasty furniture
adorned the best “sitting-room,” and Letty’s brilliant
performance on by far the best piano in the village,
caused many a hasty step to loiter on its way, as it
passed the tailor’s door. Nor were the listeners
confined to the outside of the house, for within were
frequently found all the “most desirable” young
men, who showed a decided preference for Letty’s
fine music and lively conversation, to the more dignified,
but less agreeable assemblages of the exclusives
of the place. Nor abroad did she attract less
admiration than at home, and envy itself was at
length compelled to confess that Letty Rawdon was
by far the best dressed and most stylish girl in the
village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a natural consequence, suitors followed. Phil
Dubbs, the only child of the wealthiest farmer in the
neighborhood; young Harry Edmonds, just called
to the bar, and for whom his friends already predicted
a brilliant career; Edward Simpson, the junior
partner of the principal mercantile firm in the
place, were prominent among these. Each wooed
in his peculiar way. Dubbs had enjoyed no advantages
of education beyond what the village grammar-school
afforded; but then he was an accomplished
graduate in all rural sports. No young man in the
country had as good a horse, or rode him as well;
he had the best pointers, and was the best shot to be
found in 20 miles round, and was in all such accomplishments
perfect. To him Letty was under obligations
for finishing completely one part of her education;
for he broke a favorite colt for her especial
use, and under his skillful tuition she became a
fearless and accomplished horse-woman. Edmonds
quoted Byron and Moore to her constantly, when
he had better have been employed over Coke and
Starkie; and spoiled as much paper in perpetrating
bad verses to her, as would have sufficed for his
pleas and declarations during a year’s practice; and
Simpson never returned from “the city,” whither he
went to make the purchases of goods for his firm,
without a selection of the choicest articles for Letty’s
especial use, accompanied with directions as to the
latest style of making them up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus strengthened and fortified, Letty saw her
foes gradually yielding before her. One by one they
surrendered at discretion, until Mrs. Baxter, herself,
at last sought the acquaintance, and at twenty years
of age, Letty Rawdon, the tailor’s daughter, stood
the supreme arbitress of <span class='it'>ton</span> in her native village.
Although she was grateful to her allies for the assistance
they had afforded her, she was by no means
disposed to bestow herself in return on any of them.
She was not one of those whose hearts are easily
won. She was prodigal of her smiles; she was
ready to do a kind act, or say a kind word, but the
surrender of her heart and hand was another matter.
She was ambitious of social distinction. She had
achieved the highest place at home, and she panted
for triumphs yet to come on a wider and loftier stage.
Since she had left school her time had not been misspent.
She continued to cultivate, under the tuition
of her former master, her very decided musical
talents; her mind was strengthened and enlarged by
a course of judicious reading, for which Harry Edmonds
supplied her with the material; and the foreign
languages she had acquired were not forgotten.
She felt herself far superior to all her companions,
and that her genius was hidden in the comparatively
obscure place in which her lot was cast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are few women who do not at some period
or other, or in some form or other, meet their fate in
the shape of a man. Happy, they, who are exempt
from this general calamity of the sex; for calamity
in too many cases we believe it to be. For our
part, we plead guilty to a sneaking liking to single
women, yclept by vulgar minds, old maids. Under
this denomination, we do not, however, include that
numerous bond of “single sisters,” hovering between
the ages of 35 and 45, to whom a superannuated bachelor,
or an interesting widower, especially if he be
a parson with a half a dozen responsibilities, is a god-send.
Oh, no! we mean none of these, but one of
these dignified ladies, of nameless age and easy
fortune, of whom all of us count one or more among
our acquaintance. Where are such complete establishments
to be found as among these? Go to visit
them, and your ears are not deafened by a practicing
miss of 14, thumping an unfortunate piano, until if it
had any powers of speech it would certainly cry out
“pianissimo;” or by one of those lively squalls from
the upper regions, which resembles nothing earthly
but the serenade of an amatory cat at midnight.
From these, and such like annoyances you are exempt,
and then if you enjoy the privilege of an intimacy
which admits you to the tea-table—where else
is such superb Imperial or glorious Souchong to be
found? Piping hot, it is poured into a cup of such
clean and delicate texture, that the fragrance of the
grateful shrub is heightened thereby. The water
with which it has been compounded has certainly
boiled. Just the right quantity has been admixed.
It does not require to be ruined, by having a supply
of tepid water added to it after it has been poured in
to your cup; nor does it come on table a tasteless
slops, at which even a four-footed animal, unmentionable
to ears polite, would utter a grunt of dissent
if presented to it. No. Commend me to one of
those tea-tables. The muffins also, are so hot, so
“just done;” or the toast without being burned to a
cinder, or hardened to a board, is crisp and delightful
as the most fastidious could require. The cream,
too—please do not mention it—the same milk-man
may serve her next door neighbor, but in her mansion
no skim-milk is mixed therewith, to eke out to
a large family the amount required in the compound
used therein, and which is called by courtesy, tea.
And then the sugar, sparkling as so many diamonds
in the antique silver bowl in which it rests; no
“broken-topped” or “crushed,” but “Stewart’s” or
“Lovering’s extra loaf” is alone used here. It sometimes
happens that a “<span class='it'>petit souper</span>” is substituted
for the tea-table. The oysters, Morris river coves,
when they can be had, certainly: the terrapins, none
but the genuine Egg-harbors ever enter her doors,
and the inimitable John Irwin has exhausted on them
all the resources of his skill. All the appliances of
her table are in keeping, and as you admire the dignified
courtesy with which she attends to the wants
of each guest, or leads the conversation into channels
she thinks most acceptable to those around her, the
mind involuntarily recurs to the days of hoops and
hair-powder, trains and high-heeled shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In those days, rail-roads were a thing which had
entered into the imagination of no man as a mode of
travel, and he who should have spoken of an iron
horse rushing on his course, and drawing hundreds
of human beings after him at a speed of 30 miles an
hour, would have been considered quite as great a
believer in the marvelous, as those now are, who
have faith in Paine’s light. Even post-coaches were
a novelty off of the great thoroughfares, and the public
conveyance usual to such small places as Middlebury,
was the old long-bodied stage, with its three
or four seats behind the driver’s, and stowing away
some ten or twelve passengers. Blessings on those
old carriages, we say. It is true, their pace rarely
got up to five miles an hour, and that at every five
miles or so they stopped “to water,” at an expense
of some fifteen minutes of time; but what of that?
Minutes seem to be more valuable to travelers now,
than hours were then. But what mixed feelings did
not these produce in our bosom, when seated in the
old stage on our route out of town for the holydays,
between impatience to arrive at our journey’s end,
and the airy fabrics we erected, of what we should
do when we reached there. There was the best and
kindest of grandmothers as impatiently waiting for
the arrival which was to enable her to spoil “the
boys” with indulgences, as we were to be spoiled.
There was the well-remembered pony, a little less
anxious we opine to be dashed around the country,
than we were to dash him. Then, there was the
mill-dam, where the many-colored sun-fish awaited
our hook and worms, and the bathing-place below
the dam, where we could venture to try our newly-acquired
skill across “the hole” without danger;
and the store, where gingerbread and candy, and
pipes for soap-suds bubbles were bought, with those
“odd quarters” which grandma so freely bestowed.
Who can ever forget these early days? And the
deeper he sinks into the sere and yellow leaf, the
brighter do they rise up. They constitute the small
portion of our lives upon which we can look back
with perfect complacency; for the light shadows
which once partially clouded them have long since
faded away and been forgotten, and nought but the
memory of the bright joyous sunshine remains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old stage which plied between Middlebury
and the city of Quakerdelphia, one day landed as a
passenger at the former place a young man of some
thirty years of age. Whether business or pleasure
attracted him thither is of no consequence to this
story, although from the character of the man it was
more probably the former. At the age of sixteen
John Smithson found himself an apprentice in a dry-goods
store of Quakerdelphia. He had come thither
with a sound constitution, a good, solid English education,
such as was then less frequently obtained in
country schools than now is; great industry and indomitable
perseverance. These last traits had early
attracted the attention of his acquaintance, and his
success in whatever he should undertake predicted.
He soon attracted the attention and confidence of his
employers, and the respective grades of apprentice,
clerk, and junior partner were attained by him. In
the mercantile world he had for some time been
noted for his intimate acquaintance with and complete
knowledge of business, and for the integrity,
straightforwardness and manliness of his character,
and no one was surprised when the senior member
of the firm retired a year before, that it took the title
of Jones, Smithson &amp; Co. John Smithson had
achieved mercantile distinction. Wealth had commenced
flowing in upon him in a continuous and
unbroken stream, and a few years would in all probability
see him among the richest merchants of his
adopted city. But social distinctions were wanting
to him. In his younger days he had been too busy
to think of matrimony, or indeed, of female society
at all. He was too much engaged in achieving the position
he now occupied to care much for aught else,
and his intercourse with men had rubbed off the
awkward angles of the raw country lad. Still the
want of refined female society had necessarily left
him without that polish which can be derived from
it alone. He occupied then no social position. His
home connection was respectable, and his growing
wealth would enable him to take a place among the
magnates about him; all his future, then, depended
on his choice of a wife; for he began about this time
to be cognizant of the fact that it was high time for
him to marry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was fully impressed with this idea when he
first met Letty Rawdon, nor did subsequent interviews
with her serve to weaken the impression.
Indeed, he began to be fully convinced of the necessity
of the fact, and after paying some four or five
visits to Middlebury, determined to inquire of Letty
what was her opinion on the subject. On being interrogated
by him, therefore, on this point, she still
further strengthened his determination by agreeing
fully with him thereon. Here was one point gained.
Still another step, however, was to be taken. He
again had recourse to his adviser, and she, on being
interrogated whether it would be best for her to
drop the name of Rawdon and take that of Smithson,
determined it also affirmatively, to the entire satisfaction
of the querist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Letty, clear-sighted woman that she was, saw at
an early period of her acquaintance the influence she
was gradually acquiring over John Smithson. It is
true he was not very handsome, but he had a manly,
intelligent face and a good figure. If he did not understand
all the mazes of a cotillion—waltzing was
then unknown here, and the polka would have horrified
our reputable predecessors—he had not entirely
forgotten all the figures of the country-dance or the
reel which he had learned when a boy. He rode
well, too, and often accompanied the young lady in
her gallops about the country. It is true he was more
conversant with the qualities of Yorkshire woolens
or India piece-goods, than with most of those lighter
accomplishments by which alone many conceited
addle-pates think that women are to be caught. But
he was by no means uninformed. His reading had
not been very extensive, but as far as it went it had
been good—history, biography, travels comprised
the chief of it—Shakspeare had, however, attracted
him to his magic page, and many an idle hour which
had been spent by many of his brother clerks in the
theatre, the oyster-cellar or the billiard-room, had
been passed by him in the manner above described.
He was a close observer also of men and things, and
Letty soon began to find his society much more to
her taste than that of any unmarried man with
whom she had ever associated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She then asked herself the state of her own heart.
Ambitious though she was, she was too true and
honest a woman to give her hand without her heart;
and after a brief, but careful consultation with herself,
decided that she could in all honesty take him
“for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer.” In
a worldly point of view it was the chance of a lifetime.
The rich and rising merchant of the great
city proposing to make her, the daughter of a village
tailor, the future partner of his greatness. Letty
was not insensible to this—we will not say she was
grateful for it; she had too just an appreciation of
her own merits to be so; but she was not blind to its
advantages in a worldly point of view. Had it occurred
some two years sooner, all the aristocracy of
Middlebury would have cried out “shame;” but now
it was received as a thing of course, and Smithson
was warmly congratulated on his admirable taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was decided by Letty, and confirmed by Smithson,
that in order to secure high social position, a
good start was necessary. There must be no false
step, no blunder at the outset. How many apparently
promising fortunes has this one false step
marred. He accordingly took a good house in the
most desirable part of Hazelnut street, the very
centre and focus of fashion in Quakerdelphia. To
furnish the house was in those days the business of
the wife, and Letty determined to disburse the, for
his situation, very considerable dower her father
could give her, in fitting up her new mansion, leaving
it to her future lord and master to furnish the sinews
of war for carrying on the ensuing campaigns. Accompanied
by her former preceptress, the assistance
of whose taste she had evoked, Letty proceeded on
her first visit to “the city.” We shall not stop to
describe her first sensations on entering so large a
place. Reading and descriptions had given her a
pretty correct idea of what a city was, and she did
not, like another country-girl we have heard of,
complain “that she could not see the town for the
houses.” Let not this be considered an exaggeration,
for the reverse of the case occurred in our own
presence a very few years since. We were at a
country-house a few miles from the city, when a
friend of its owner arrived there, accompanied by
one of her children, a lovely little girl of some five
years of age. From some cause or other she had
never since she could remember been in the country
before, and delighted with all she saw—the trees,
the green fields, the flowers, she hurried with a
smiling face to her mother, exclaiming—“Oh,
mamma, is this indeed the real country?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a day or so devoted to sight-seeing, the
serious business which brought her there was entered
upon by Letty. Cabinet-makers were visited,
upholsterers consulted, and trades-people of various
kinds looked in upon, until finally, like a genuine
woman, she stopped buying, simply because her
money was all gone. Articles of <span class='it'>vertu</span> were not
so common in those days as now, but yet our friend
contrived to mingle a good deal of the ornamental
with all of the useful in her purchases, and when,
some time after, a carriage whirled to the door of a
capacious Hazelnut street mansion, and a lady and
gentleman descended therefrom, few ladies of Quakerdelphia
entered a more elegant and luxurious
home than did Mrs. John Smithson when she passed
its portals.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Acquaintances Letty had none in the great city.
Mrs. Jones, the lady of her husband’s partner, of
course called upon her and gave her a party, to
which her acquaintance generally were invited. Now,
though Mrs. Jones and her friends belonged most
strictly to the class called respectable and genteel,
yet they were not fashionable. Letty appeared to
comprehend this as it were by intuition. Nature
had certainly intended her to be somebody—she accordingly
took her line of conduct at once, and she
determined that though circumstances required that
with Mrs. Jones an air of cordiality and sociability
must be preserved, yet this was not so necessary
with that lady’s friends. Letty never cut any body
directly. Her innate sense of propriety and natural
good-breeding revolted from a course to which none
but people of vulgar minds and shallow parts ever
resort. She possessed, however, a tact which enabled
her to drop an acquaintance without the slightest
seemingness of rudeness or ill-manners. She
knew how first to smile most cordially when she
met the “droppee,” to wonder—</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was so long since they had met; she supposed,
however, it must be her fault, but she had been
so busy she had not been able to pay half her visits;
to press the hand slightly, and with a smile an
angel might almost envy, to say, “Good-bye, I will
endeavor soon—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then glide gently away before the sentence
was filled up. And this was the last of it. On the
next meeting a sweet smile, a courteous bow, but
no time to speak; and so the season passed; no
visit exchanged, each eradicated the other’s name
from her “list”—the object was effected not only
without offense, but with such ease and grace, that
the dropped was afterward heard to say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think Mrs. A. a most lovely woman, and regret
I was compelled by circumstances I could not help
to stop visiting her, and so she has given me up.”
Mrs. C. is not the only deluded mortal in this
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Smithson, we have seen, had determined that
Mrs. Jones’s “set” were not to become her “set.”
She was willing to bide her time. She was aware
that great events are usually the creatures of slow
growth. They may at the last grow with rapidity,
but the seed which produces them has been for a
long time germinating. She believed that a cultivated
mind and accomplished person joined to a determined
will, can achieve anything it pleases in the
social as in other worlds, and she was determined to
prove the truth of her convictions in her own case,
and so she went on improving her mind, perfecting
her accomplishments and biding her time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Smithson, like all other reputable gentlemen,
had, on becoming a married man, taken a pew in
church. It was in a fashionable church, which then
meant an Episcopal church, for fashion in those
days was pretty much monopolized in Quakerdelphia
by Episcopalians and a few degenerate descendants
of the co-religionists of Penn, who had
departed wofully in dress and manners from the
primitive simplicity of “Friends.” Now-a-days
things are somewhat altered, as one may perceive at
a glance on entering some of the Presbyterian
churches in the fashionable part of the city—the
display of velvets, brocades and furs, the oceans of
feathers and parterres of flowers show that their
owners have entered on the race, and that it is almost
a dead heat. Nor has the innovation ceased
here. The full, rich, deep swell of the organ has
been substituted for the bass-viol, and (rise not at the
mention of it, shades of Knox and Calvin,) it is
rumored that your descendants are about to worship
in a Gothic temple, with its windows of stained-glass
through which the “dim religious light” is to penetrate,
and dim enough it is during our short winter
afternoons. Whether the resemblance to the “Mass-houses”
which were torn down in the sixteenth century
is to be carried out fully in the interior as well
as exterior, we have not learned, nor whether it is
only to be confined to “sedilia,” “screen,” “south-porch,”
“octagonal font at the door,” or whether
any or none of these remains of Medievalism are to
have a place within. The “Ecclesiologist” no
doubt can enlighten our readers, and to that we refer
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Smithson, as we said, took a pew in a fashionable
church, and in a desirable position. Thither,
accompanied by his fashionable-looking wife, who,
in her turn, was accompanied by her richly-bound
prayer-book, he resorted on Sunday mornings. The
attention of the devotees around was at once attracted
by her, and stray glances would slip from
the leaf of the prayer-book to the “new person” near
by. “<span class='it'>N’importe</span>,” Letty might say, as did a celebrated
English dandy when an hundred opera-glasses
were leveled at him, “Let them look and die.”
With her attire no fault could be found. The material
was of the richest and most costly kind, the
colors most harmoniously combined; the fit perfect,
showing her willowy and graceful figure to the utmost
advantage, and the furs genuine martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is she?” was the whispered colloquy, as
the parties proceeded down the aisle, with a glance
over the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you know—her name is Smithson. A
rich Shamble street merchant. Live in Hazelnut
street, in old Corkscrew’s house—said to be splendidly
furnished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but who is she? Where does she come
from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know exactly; but believe from New
York, or Baltimore, or Richmond, or somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very definite—and the last location very likely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what do you think of her? Very lady-looking—don’t
you think so? And how beautifully she
dresses. Her muff and tippet are certainly martin—and
what a love of a hat. Martine tells me she
paid $25 for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the ladies having reached the door, the edifying
commentary on the sermon just delivered ceased,
and the parties separating, pursued their several
ways. The first speaker, or querist, was Mrs.
Rodgers, one of the most decided leaders of the
<span class='it'>ton</span> in Quakerdelphia, whose father having retired
from trade as a hardware merchant when she was
a very little girl, felt her superiority to those of her
acquaintances who were still engaged in trade.
Her husband was in the same position as herself,
and their united fortunes enabled him to provide his
friends with the finest clarets, the oldest Madeiras,
the fattest venison, and one of the greatest bores at
the head of his own table who ever spoiled good
wine by prosing over it. His lady gave no balls
nor grand routes; she was too exclusive for that;
but admittance to her “Evenings” was eagerly
sought after by all who aspired to be of the <span class='it'>ton</span>.
The other lady, Mrs. Cackle, a widow, was one of
those gossips who are everywhere found. Her
pretensions to fashion were only pretensions, and
she held her own in the gay world simply by making
herself useful as the purveyor of all the fashionable
scandal of the day to her fashionable acquaintance.
Mrs. Rodgers and others of her set, would have as
soon thought of doing without their cards or their
carriages as without “Cackle,” as she was familiarly
called; and hence she was at home in all the
“best houses” of Quakerdelphia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pew which the Smithsons occupied, was adjoining
that of Mrs. Rodgers. It was the family-pew
of a certain Mrs. Edmonson, who, after a long
career in the gay world, had recently, alarmed by
conscience or gray hairs, abandoned cards for prayer-meetings,
and despairing of “grace” under what she
was pleased to term “the didactic essays and moral
teachings” of Dr. Silky, her pastor, had abandoned
them for the preachings of the Rev. Mr. Thunder, a
celebrated revivalist. Here a new scene was opened
for her. Possibly her jaded feelings may have required
some new and varied stimulant. We do
not say so positively. We merely repeat what
“Cackle” said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor, dear soul! she was so worn-out with
whist and piquett, that any change was for the
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Be this as it may, she certainly entered upon her
new course of life with much zeal. She faithfully
attended not only the three regular Sunday services,
but all the occasional week-day lectures and familiar
meetings for prayer and religious conversation.
These latter were always preceded by tea at the
house of some of the sisters of the Rev. Mr. Thunder’s
flock. Projects for converting the world were
then new, and the recent convert entered upon them
with all the zeal which had formerly animated her
when arranging the details of a ball or of a party for
the theatre. The dwellers in Africa and the isles
of the Pacific, occupied much of their attention; but
they did not seem to know that within a few squares
of where they were engaged alternately in sipping
tea or expounding prophecy, dwelt a population,
perhaps more degraded and more requiring enlightenment,
than those over whose darkness they
mourned. The inhabitant of Africa thought nothing
of a Saviour of whom he had never heard. The
denizen of St. Anne’s street uttered his name only to
blaspheme. Which of these, according to the doctrine
as laid down by the Apostle to the Gentiles,
most required the humanizing influences of the missionary
of the cross, we leave to each to determine
for himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thing is certain. Had Mrs. Edmonson not
been thus called off, Mrs. Smithson could not have
obtained the pew which she now occupied. A
gradual acquaintance was beginning to spring up
between her and Mrs. Rodgers, arising from the
principle of contiguity. Commend us to that principle.
It has settled the fate of many a son and
daughter of Eve. It commenced we know not
how. It was probably from some one of those thousand
and one little offices which neighborhood induces.
A shawl may have become entangled in something
requiring the friendly offices of a neighbor to unloose;
or the warmth of the weather may have
created an uncomfortable feeling, which the opportune
loan of a fan may have relieved. How the acquaintanceship
in question was first brought about
we have forgotten—if we ever knew. It is of no
consequence to us. Every one knows the progress
of these things. At first it is a distant bow, as much
as to say, “I should like to know you, but don’t
care to advance.” Then came a casual and passing
remark, as they emerged from the pew to the aisle.
Then the walk down the aisle, side by side, until
reaching the door, when each assumed her husband’s
arm, and the respective couples mingled in the
crowd; and finally the continued walk together to
the parting-place, whence each pursues the path to
their own residence. These things have often occurred
before; they were enacted by Mesdames
Rogers and Smithson then, and will occur again.
Their husbands followed slowly in the rear, discussing
the state of the weather, the prospects of
business, the likelihood of speedy news from Europe,
there not having been an arrival for upward of
a month, with other topics of a kindred nature.
Mrs. Rodgers, a well-educated lady of considerable
conversational powers, found the mind of her new
acquaintance as agreeable as her person, and before
they separated,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hoped she might be permitted to improve the
acquaintance thus opportunely begun, by calling on
Mrs. Smithson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Letty graciously gave the required permission,
expressing all that courtesy demanded on the occasion,
but carefully abstaining from appearing overwhelmed
with the compliment, as many a weaker
minded and less skillful tactician would have done.
She knew that her cue was to meet advances half-way,
but not to pass the line one hair’s breadth, if
she wished any new acquaintance to be made to feel,
than in seeking her, the obligation was mutual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the next day but one Mrs. Rodgers was
ushered into Letty’s drawing-room. That lady did
not detain her long before she made her appearance,
but still dallied sufficiently to allow the other to take
in at a rapid glance the completeness of her establishment.
Her experience, however, was for once
at fault, for she determined hastily that the woman
who could arrange her rooms with such taste, must
have been surrounded by like refinements and elegancies
all her life. Her reception of Letty, therefore,
when she arrived, was most cordial and impressive.
The season was far advanced. Her last
“Evening” was on that of the succeeding day, “and
it was to secure Mrs. Smithson’s appearance as well
as further to cultivate so pleasant an acquaintance
thus agreeably begun, that she had called this morning,
etc.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Smithson, on her part, would be very happy
to make one at this exclusive assemblage, and a
very unfashionably long visit for a morning call
followed. Mrs. Rodgers was anxious to find out
all about Letty, who she was, where she came
from, etc.; but was foiled in all her skillful questions,
by answers equally skillful. When at length
she took her leave, she could not help pondering on
this to herself. She admitted her curiosity about it,
but wound up by saying to herself, be she who she
may, she is certainly a most agreeable personage,
and I think I have made a most decided hit in introducing
her into our set.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Letty, she was all exultation on the departure
of her visitor. She saw herself achieving at
once the distinctions she panted after. Not only
were the doors of the drawing-room of dame Fashion
opened to her, but as she passed through them with
firm step and head erect amid the ill-concealed envy
of the crowd which filled them, she saw the curtains
of the boudoir drawn aside at her approach,
and she was admitted into the inmost presence-chamber
of the goddess. Not so fast, Letty. You
certainly have mounted the first rung of the ladder;
and my readers and myself know you now too well
to fear for a moment that you will go backward;
but there is many a step yet to climb before you
reach that giddy height on which you aspire to
stand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next evening soon came, and after almost all
the guests had assembled, Mr. and Mrs. Smithson
arrived. She was arrayed in a dress of the richest
kind, and with her usual faultless taste. Her ornaments
were few, but elegant; the best of them being
that bright, fresh face and elastic form, which the dissipation
of city life had not yet impaired. She had a
severe and scathing ordeal to pass. It was felt by
several, with the keen intuition which women alone
have, that she might prove a formidable rival. Mrs.
Rodgers’ reception and treatment of her were most
kind. She introduced several most desirable acquaintances
to her, and the gentlemen in especial
were delighted with her. Letty’s earliest allies, it
may be remembered, were of the male sex; but the
gallant Colonel Lumley, and that exquisite of exquisites,
Mr. Tom Harrowby, were of a different stamp
from Phil Dubbs and even Harry Edmonds, though
the latter, in after days, achieved renown both at
the bar and in the senate-chamber. The evening
passed but too delightfully and too rapidly for Letty.
She felt that she was at last among kindred minds,
and on arriving at home, when she reviewed what
had transpired as she was preparing for her night’s
repose, she was satisfied that her debut had been
eminently successful, and that she had made a decided
hit. With visions of much future greatness
before her, she fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> practice of interment in churches and church-yards
prevailed in Paris till near the end of the
eighteenth century. In 1790 the National Assembly
passed a law commanding all towns and villages to
discontinue the use of their old burial-places, and
form others at a distance from their habitations.
An imperial decree was issued in 1804, ordering
high ground to be chosen for cemeteries, and every
corpse to be interred at a depth of at least six feet.
Another decree, of 1811, ordained a company of undertakers,
to whom the whole business of interment
was to be consigned, who arranged funerals in six
classes, and established a tariff of expense for the
service rendered. The cemeteries of Paris are four
in number. Père-la-chaise, Montmartre, Vaugirard,
and Mont-Parnasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Père-la-chaise, the subject of the beautiful engraving
in our present number—engraved for us by
J. A. Rolph, of New York—occupies a tract of high
and sloping ground to the north-east of Paris. It
derives its name from the confessor of Louis XIV.,
who occupied a splendid mansion on its site—a
country-house of the Jesuits for more than one hundred
and fifty years. This beautiful burial-ground
was consecrated in 1804, and on the 21st of May of
that year the first burial took place within its walls.
In the <span class='it'>fosses communes</span> the poor are gratuitously
interred in coffins placed side by side, without ornament
or mark of any kind. Temporary graves, to
be held for six years, may be procured for fifty
francs, and may afterward be retained on five years’
lease by the regular payment of the same sum. If
afterward purchased, a deduction of the first payment
of fifty francs is made. The ground is purchased
in perpetuity at a rate of one hundred and
twenty francs per square metre, where vaults may
be sunk or monuments erected at the pleasure of the
owner. Many of the most celebrated personages
of France here repose in the dreamless sleep, amid
garlands and flowers. Baron Cuvier, Casimir
Périer and Benjamin Constant. Marshals Ney,
Suchet, Massena, Lefèvre—Volney rests here, with
Talma, Mademoiselle Raucourt, Macdonald, Beaumarchais,
and many whose names are imperishable
in history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The picturesque monument of Gothic architecture,
to the right on entering, contains the ashes of
Abelard and Heloisa—this sepulchre was constructed
from the ruins of the celebrated Abbey of Paracleet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We rejoice that, in our own country, a wise foresight
has already disposed our citizens to set apart
at a distance from the busy mart and the thriving
town, secluded and beautiful places for the quiet
resting-place of the beloved dead. From this pious
feeling has sprung our own Laurel-Hill—Mount
Auburn, near Boston—Greenwood, near New York,
and scores of other places appropriately named and
selected in the vicinage of cities and towns of our
country—where the monumental pile and the humble
tomb bear silent company. The roses embowering
these make the whole air fragrant, but, dying
in autumn return again with the spring, mute yet
eloquent preachers of a Final Resurrection.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>I believe</span> that sooner or later, there come to
every man, dreams of ambition. They may be
covered with the sloth of habit, or with a pretence
of humility; they may come only in dim, shadowy
visions, that feed the eye, like the glories of an ocean
sun-rise; but you may be sure that they will come:
even before one is aware, the bold, adventurous
goddess, whose name is ambition, and whose dower
is Fame, will be toying with the feeble heart. And
she pushes her ventures with a bold hand: she
makes timidity strong, and weakness valiant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The way of a man’s heart will be foreshadowed
by what goodness lies in him—coming from above,
and from around;—but a way foreshadowed, is not
a way made. And the making of a man’s way
comes only from that quickening of resolve, which
we call Ambition. It is the spur that makes man
struggle with Destiny: it is Heaven’s own incentive,
to make Purpose great, and Achievement
greater.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would be strange if you, in that cloister-life of
a college, did not sometimes feel a dawning of new
resolves. They grapple you, indeed, oftener than
you dare to speak of. Here, you dream first of that
very sweet, but very shadowy success, called reputation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You think of the delight and astonishment, it
would give your mother and father, and most of all,
little Nelly, if you were winning such honors, as
now escape you. You measure your capacities by
those about you, and watch their habit of study; you
gaze for a half hour together, upon some successful
man, who has won his prizes; and wonder by what
secret action he has done it. And when, in time,
you come to be a competitor yourself, your anxiety
is immense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You spend hours upon hours at your theme. You
write and re-write; and when it is at length complete,
and out of your hands, you are harassed by a
thousand doubts. At times, as you recal your hours
of toil, you question if so much has been spent upon
any other; you feel almost certain of success. You
repeat to yourself, some passages of special eloquence,
at night. You fancy the admiration of the
Professors at meeting with such wonderful performance.
You have a slight fear that its superior
goodness may awaken the suspicion that some one out
of the college—some superior man, may have written
it. But this fear dies away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eventful day is a great one in your calendar;
you hardly sleep the night previous. You tremble
as the chapel-bell is rung; you profess to be very indifferent,
as the reading, and the prayer close; you
even stoop to take up your hat—as if you had entirely
overlooked the fact, that the old president was in the
desk, for the express purpose of declaring the successful
names. You listen dreamily to his tremulous,
yet fearfully distinct enunciation. Your head
swims strangely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all pass out with a harsh murmur, along the
aisles, and through the door-ways. It would be well
if there were no disappointments in life more terrible
than this. It is consoling to express very depreciating
opinions of the Faculty in general;—and very
contemptuous ones of that particular officer who
decided upon the merit of the prize themes. An
evening or two at Dalton’s room go still further
toward healing the disappointment; and—if it must
be said—toward moderating the heat of your ambition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You grow up however, unfortunately, as the
college years fly by, into a very exaggerated sense
of your own capacities. Even the good, old, white-haired
squire, for whom you had once entertained
so much respect, seems to your crazy, classic fancy,
a very hum-drum sort of personage. Frank, although
as noble a fellow as ever sat a horse, is yet—you
cannot help thinking—very ignorant of Euripides;
even the English master at Dr. Bidlow’s school, you
feel sure would balk at a dozen problems you could
give him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You get an exalted idea of that uncertain quality,
which turns the heads of a vast many of your fellows,
called—Genius. An odd notion seems to
be inherent in the atmosphere of those college
chambers, that there is a certain faculty of mind—first
developed as would seem in colleges—which
accomplishes whatever it chooses, without any
special painstaking. For a time, you fall yourself
into this very unfortunate hallucination; you cultivate
it, after the usual college fashion, by drinking
a vast deal of strong coffee, and whiskey-toddy—by
writing a little poor verse, in the Byronic temper,
and by studying very late at night, with closed
blinds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It costs you, however, more anxiety and hypocrisy
than you could possibly have believed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>——You will learn, Clarence, when the Autumn
has rounded your hopeful Summer, if not before,
that there is no Genius in life, like the Genius of
energy and industry. You will learn, that all the
traditions so current among very young men, that
certain great characters have wrought their greatness
by an inspiration, as it were, grow out of a sad
mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And you will further find, when you come to
measure yourself with men, that there are no rivals
so formidable, as those earnest, determined minds,
which reckon the value of every hour, and which
achieve eminence by persistent application.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Literary ambition may inflame you at certain
periods; and a thought of some great names will flash
like a spark into the mine of your purposes; you
dream till midnight over books; you set up shadows,
and chase them down—other shadows, and they fly.
Dreaming will never catch them. Nothing makes
the “scent lie well,” in the hunt after distinction,
but labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it is a glorious thing, when once you are
weary of the dissipation, and the ennui of your own
aimless thought, to take up some glowing page of
an earnest thinker, and read—deep and long, until
you feel the metal of his thought tinkling on your
brain, and striking out from your flinty lethargy, flashes
of ideas, that give the mind light and heat. And away
you go, in the chase of what the soul within is creating
on the instant, and you wonder at the fecundity
of what seemed so barren, and at the ripeness of
what seems so crude. The glow of toil wakes
you to the consciousness of your real capacities: you
feel sure that they have taken a new step toward
final development. In such mood it is, that one
feels grateful to the musty tomes, which at other
hours, stand like curiosity-making mummies, with
no warmth, and no vitality. Now they grow into
the affections like new-found friends; and gain a
hold upon the heart, and light a fire in the brain, that
the years and the mould cannot cover, nor quench.</p>

evening by the bank of her native stream, a short distance from Mount Rosa, near the entrance of a forest, when,
charmed with the beauty of the sunset, she fell into a reverie, during which a vision passed before her, which led
her to form the resolution—which she patiently kept—of being a painter. She afterward obtained the prize from

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Amongst</span> the women of the French Revolution,
there is one who stands essentially apart: a solitary
episode of the eventful story. She appears for a moment,
performs a deed—heroic as to the intention,
criminal as to the means—and disappears for ever;
lost in the shadow of time—an unfathomed mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it is, perhaps, this very mystery that has invested
with so much interest the name of one known
by a single deed; which, though intended by her to
deliver her country, changed little in its destinies.
To admire her entirely is impossible; to condemn
her is equally difficult. No one can read her history
without feeling that, to judge her absolutely, lies not
in the province of man. Beautiful, pure, gentle, and
a murderess, she attracts and repels us in almost
equal degrees; like all those beings whose nature is
inexplicable and strange, according to the ordinary
standard of humanity. Although it is generally acknowledged
that site did not exercise over contemporary
events that repressing power for which she
sacrificed her life, it is felt, nevertheless, that no history
of the times in which she lived, is complete
without her name; and to her brief and tragic history
an eloquent modern historian<a id='r12'/><a href='#f12' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[12]</span></sup></a> has devoted
some of his most impressive pages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The 31st of May was the signal of the fall and dispersion
of the Girondists. Some, like Barbaroux,
Buzot, Louvet, and their friends, retired to the provinces,
which they endeavored to rouse for one last
struggle. Others, like Madame Roland and the
twenty-two, prepared themselves in their silent prison
solitude for death and the scaffold. The name
of the Girondists now became a sound as proscribed
as that of Royalist had been during their brief sway.
No voice gifted with power was raised throughout
the republic in favor of the men by whom, in the
midst of such enthusiastic acclamations, that republic
had been founded. France was rapidly sinking
into that state of silent apathy which foreboded the
Reign of Terror: discouraged by their experience
of the past, men lost their faith in humanity, and selfishly
despaired of the future. A maiden’s heroic
spirit alone conceived the daring project of saving
those who had so long and so nobly striven for freedom;
or, if this might not be, of avenging their fall,
and striking terror into the hearts of their foes, by a
deed of solemn immolation, worthy of the stern
sacrifices of paganism, offered of yore on the blood-stained
shrines of the goddess Nemesis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maiden was Marie-Anne Charlotte, of Corday
and of Armont, one of the last descendants of a noble,
though impoverished Norman family, which counted
amongst its near relatives, Fontenelle, the wit and
philosopher of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
and amongst its ancestors, the father of the great
tragic poet of France, Pierre Corneille.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father, Jacques of Corday and of Armont,
was a younger son of this noble line. He was,
however, poorer than many of the peasants amongst
whom he lived, cultivating with his own hands, his
narrow inheritance. He married in early life a lady
of gentle blood, but as poor as himself. They had
five children and a noble name to support, in a vain
show of dignity, on their insufficient income. It
thus happened that Charlotte, their fourth child and
second daughter, was born in a thatched dwelling, in
the village of Saint-Saturnin des Lignerets; and that
in the register of the parish church where she was
baptized, on the 28th of July, 1768, the day after her
birth, she is described as “born in lawful wedlock
of Jacques Francois of Corday, esquire, sieur of Armont,
and of the noble dame Marie Charlotte-Jacqueline,
of Gauthier des Authieux, his wife.” It was
under these difficult circumstances, which embittered
his temper, and often caused him to inveigh in energetic
terms against the injustice of the law of primogeniture,
that M. d’Armont reared his family. As
soon as they were of age, his sons entered the army;
one of his daughters died young; and he became a
widower when the other two were emerging from
childhood into youth. They remained for some time
with their father, but at length entered the Abbaye
aux Dames, in the neighboring town of Caen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The greatest portion of the youth of Charlotte
Corday—to give her the name by which she is generally
known—was spent in the calm obscurity of her
convent solitude. Many high visions, many burning
dreams and lofty aspirations, already haunted her
imaginative and enthusiastic mind, as she slowly
paced the silent cloisters, or rested, lost in thought,
beneath the shadow of the ancient elms. It is said
that, like Madame Roland, she contemplated secluding
herself for ever from the world in her monastic
retreat; but, affected by the scepticism of the age,
which penetrated even beyond convent walls, she
gave up this project. From these early religions
feelings, Charlotte derived, however, the calm devotedness
which characterized her brief career: for
though self-sacrifice may not be the exclusive attribute
of Christianity, it cannot be denied that the
deep humility by which it is accompanied—a feeling
almost unknown to the ancients—is in itself the very
spirit of Christ. The peaceful and solemn shadow
of the old cloister favored the mild seriousness of
Charlotte’s character. Within the precincts of her
sacred retreat she grew up in grave and serene loveliness,
a being fit for the gentlest duties of woman’s
household life, or for one of those austere and fearless
deeds which lead to the scaffold and give martyrdom
in a holy cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scepticism that prevailed for the last few
years preceding the Revolution, was not the sensual
atheism which had disgraced the eighteenth century
so long. The faith in a first and eternal cause, in the
sacredness of human rights and the holiness of duty,
was firmly held by many noble spirits, who hailed
with enthusiasm the first dawn of democracy. This
faith was blended in the soul of Charlotte Corday,
with a passionate admiration of antiquity. All the
austerity and republican enthusiasm of her illustrious
ancestor, Pierre Corneille, seemed to have come
down to his young descendant. Even Rousseau
and Raynal, the apostles of democracy, had no pages
that could absorb her so deeply as those of ancient
history, with its stirring deeds and immortal recollections.
Often, like Manon Philipon, in the recess
of her father’s workshop, might Charlotte Corday be
seen in her convent cell, thoughtfully bending over
an open volume of Plutarch; that powerful and eloquent
historian of all heroic sacrifices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Abbaye aux Dames was closed, in consequence
of the Revolution, Charlotte was in her
twentieth year, in the prime of life and of her wonderful
beauty; and never, perhaps, did a vision of
more dazzling loveliness step forth from beneath the
dark convent portal into the light of the free and open
world. She was rather tall, but admirably proportioned,
with a figure full of native grace and dignity;
her hands, arms, and shoulders, were models of pure
sculptural beauty. An expression of singular gentleness
and serenity characterized her fair, oval countenance
and regular features. Her open forehead,
dark and well-arched eyebrows, and eyes of a gray
so deep that it was often mistaken for blue, added to
her naturally grave and meditative appearance; her
nose was straight and well formed, her mouth serious
but exquisitely beautiful. Like most of the women
of the Norman race, she had a complexion of transparent
purity; enhanced by the rich brown hair
which fell in thick curls around her neck, according
to the fashion of the period. A simple severity
characterized her dress of sombre hue, and the low
and becoming lace cap which she habitually wore is
still known by her name in France. Her whole aspect
was fraught with so much modest grace and
dignity, that, notwithstanding her youth, the first
feeling she invariably inspired was one of respect;
blended with involuntary admiration, for a being of
such pure and touching loveliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On leaving the convent in which she had been
educated, Charlotte Corday went to reside with her
aunt, Madame Coutellier de Bretteville Gouville;
an old royalist lady, who inhabited an ancient-looking
house in one of the principal streets of Caen.
There the young girl, who had inherited a little property,
spent several years, chiefly engaged in watching
the progress of the Revolution. The feelings of
her father were similarly engrossed: he wrote several
pamphlets in favor of the revolutionary principles;
and one in which he attacked the right of primogeniture.
His republican tendencies confirmed
Charlotte in her opinions; but of the deep, overpowering
strength which those opinions acquired in
her soul, during the long hours she daily devoted to
meditation, no one ever knew, until a stern and fearful
deed—more stern and fearful in one so gentle—had
revealed it to all France. A silent reserve
characterized this epoch of Charlotte Corday’s life:
her enthusiasm was not external, but inward: she
listened to the discussions which were carried on
around her without taking a part in them herself. She
seemed to feel instinctively that great thoughts are
always better nursed in the heart’s solitude: that
they can only lose their native depth and intensity
by being revealed too freely before the indifferent
gaze of the world. Those with whom she then occasionally
conversed, took little heed of the substance
of her discourse, and could remember nothing
of it when she afterward became celebrated; but all
recollected well her voice, and spoke with strange
enthusiasm of its pure, silvery sound. Like Madame
Roland, whom she resembled in so many respects,
Charlotte possessed this rare and great attraction;
and there was something so touching in her youthful
and almost childlike utterance of heroic thoughts,
that it affected even to tears those who heard her on
her trial, calmly defending herself from the infamous
accusations of her judges, and glorying with the same
low, sweet tones, in the deadly deed which had
brought her before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fall of the Girondists, on the 31st of May,
first suggested to Charlotte Corday the possibility of
giving an active shape to her hitherto passive feelings.
She watched with intense, though still silent,
interest the progress of events, concealing her secret
indignation and thoughts of vengeance under her habitually
calm aspect. Those feelings were heightened
in her soul by the presence of the fugitive Girondists,
who had found a refuge in Caen, and were
urging the Normans to raise an army to march on
Paris. She found a pretence to call upon Barbaroux,
then with his friends at the Intendance. She came
twice, accompanied by an old servant, and protected
by her own modest dignity. Pethion saw her in the
hall, where she was waiting for the handsome Girondist,
and observed, with a smile—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, the beautiful aristocrat is come to see republicans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Citizen Pethion,” she replied, “you now judge
me without knowing me, but a time will come what
you shall learn who I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Barbaroux, Charlotte chiefly conversed of
the imprisoned Girondists; of Madame Roland and
Marat. The name of this man had long haunted her
with a mingled feeling of dread and horror. To
Marat she ascribed the proscription of the Girondists,
the woes of the republic, and on him she resolved to
avenge her ill-fated country. Charlotte was not
aware that Marat was but the tool of Dunton and
Robespierre. “If such actions could be counseled,”
afterward said Barbaroux, “it is not Marat whom
we would have advised her to strike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst this deadly thought was daily strengthening
itself in Charlotte’s mind, she received several offers
of marriage. She declined them, on the plea of
wishing to remain free: but strange indeed must
have seemed to her, at that moment, those proposals
of earthly love. One of those whom her beauty had
enamored, M. de Franquelin, a young volunteer in
the cause of the Girondists, died of grief on learning
her fate. His last request was, that her portrait and
a few letters he had formerly received from her,
might be buried with him in his grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For several days after her last interview with Barbaroux,
Charlotte brooded silently over her great
thought, often meditating on the history of Judith.
Her aunt subsequently remembered that, on entering
her room one morning, she found an old Bible open
on her bed: the verse in which it is recorded that
“the Lord had gifted Judith with a special beauty
and fairness,” for the deliverance of Israel, was underlined
with a pencil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On another occasion Madame de Bretteville found
her niece weeping alone; she inquired into the cause
of her tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They flow,” replied Charlotte, “for the misfortunes
of my country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heroic and devoted as she was, she then also
wept, perchance, over her own youth and beauty,
so soon to be sacrificed for ever. No personal considerations
altered her resolve; she procured a passport,
provided herself with money, and paid a farewell
visit to her father, to inform him that, considering
the unsettled condition of France, she thought it
best to retire to England. He approved of her intention,
and bade her adieu. On returning to Caen,
Charlotte told the same tale to Madame de Bretteville,
left a secret provision for an old nurse, and distributed
the little property she possessed amongst her
friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the morning of the 9th of July, 1793,
that she left the house of her aunt, without trusting
herself with a last farewell. Her most earnest wish
was, when her deed should have been accomplished,
to perish, wholly unknown, by the hands of an infuriated
multitude. The woman who could contemplate
such a fate, and calmly devote herself to it,
without one selfish thought of future renown, had indeed
the heroic soul of a martyr.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her journey to Paris was marked by no other
event than the unwelcome attentions of some Jacobins
with whom she traveled. One of them, struck
by her modest and gentle beauty, made her a very
serious proposal of marriage: she playfully evaded
his request, but promised that he should learn who
and what she was at some future period. On entering
Paris, she proceeded immediately to the Hotel
de la Providence, Rue des Vieux Augustins, not far
from Marat’s dwelling. Here she rested for two
days, before calling on her intended victim. Nothing
can mark more forcibly the singular calmness
of her mind: she felt no hurry to accomplish the
deed for which she had journeyed so far, and over
which she had meditated so deeply: her soul remained
serene and undaunted to the last. The room
which she occupied, and which has been often
pointed out to inquiring strangers, was a dark and
wretched attic, into which light scarcely ever penetrated.
There she read again the volume of Plutarch
she had brought with her—unwilling to part
from her favorite author even in her last hours—and
probably composed that energetic address to the people,
which was found upon her after her apprehension.
One of the first acts of Charlotte was to call
on the Girondist, Duperret, for whom she was provided
with a letter from Barbaroux, relative to the
supposed business she had in Paris: her real motive
was to learn how she could see Marat. She had
first intended to strike him in the Champ de Mars,
on the 14th of July, the anniversary of the fall of the
Bastille, when a great and imposing ceremony was
to take place. The festival being delayed, she resolved
to seek him in the convention, and immolate
him on the very summit of the mountain; but Marat
was too ill to attend the meetings of the National
Assembly: this Charlotte learned from Duperret.
She resolved, nevertheless, to go to the convention,
in order to fortify herself in her resolve. Mingling
with the horde of Jacobins who crowded the galleries,
she watched with deep attention the scene below.
Saint Just was then urging the convention to
proscribe Lanjuinais, the heroic defender of the Girondists.
A young foreigner, a friend of Lanjuinais,
and who stood at a short distance from Charlotte,
noticed the expression of stern indignation which
gathered over her features; until, like one over-powered
by her feelings, and apprehensive of displaying
them too openly, she abruptly left the place.
Struck with her whole appearance, he followed her
out; a sudden shower of rain, which compelled
them to seek shelter under the same archway, afforded
him an opportunity of entering into conversation
with her. When she learned that he was a
friend of Lanjuinais she waived her reserve, and
questioned him with much interest concerning Madame
Roland and the Girondists. She also asked
him about Marat, with whom she said she had some
business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marat is ill; it would be better for you to apply
to the public accuser, Fouquier Tinville,” said the
stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not want him now, but I may have to deal
with him yet,” she significantly replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perceiving that the rain did not cease, she requested
her companion to procure her a conveyance.
He complied, and before parting from her,
begged to be favored with her name. She refused,
adding, however, “You will know it before long.”
With Italian courtesy, he kissed her hand as he assisted
her into the fiacre. She smiled, and bade him
farewell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charlotte perceived that to call on Marat was the
only means by which she might accomplish her purpose.
She did so on the morning of the 13th of July,
having first purchased a knife in the Palais Royal,
and written him a note, in which she requested an
interview. She was refused admittance. She then
wrote him a second note, more pressing than the
first, and in which she represented herself as persecuted
for the cause of freedom. Without waiting to
see what effect this note might produce, she called
again at half-past seven the same evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marat then resided in the Rue des Cordeliers, in a
gloomy-looking house, which has since been demolished.
His constant fears of assassination were
shared by those around him; the porter, seeing a
strange woman pass by his lodge without pausing to
make any inquiry, ran out and called her back. She
did not heed his remonstrance, but swiftly ascended
the old stone stair-case, until she had reached the
door of Marat’s apartment. It was cautiously
opened by Albertine, a woman with whom Marat
cohabited, and who passed for his wife. Recognizing
the same young and handsome girl who had
already called on her husband, and animated, perhaps,
by a feeling of jealous mistrust, Albertine refused
to admit her: Charlotte insisted with great
earnestness. The sound of their altercation reached
Marat; he immediately ordered his wife to admit
the stranger, whom he recognized as the author of the
two letters he had received in the course of the day.
Albertine obeyed reluctantly; she allowed Charlotte
to enter; and, after crossing with her an antechamber,
where she had been occupied with a man named
Laurent Basse, in folding some numbers of the
“Ami du People,” she ushered her through two
other rooms, until they came to a narrow closet,
where Marat was then in a bath. He gave a look at
Charlotte, and ordered his wife to leave them alone:
she complied, but allowed the door of the closet to
remain half open, and kept within call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to his usual custom, Marat wore a
soiled handkerchief bound round his head, increasing
his natural hideousness. A coarse covering was
thrown across his bath; a board, likewise placed
transversely, supported his papers. Laying down
his pen, he asked Charlotte the purport of her visit.
The closet was so narrow that she touched the bath
near which she stood. She gazed on him with ill-disguised
horror and disgust, but answered as composedly
as she could, that she had come from Caen,
in order to give him correct intelligence concerning
the proceedings of the Girondists there. He listened,
questioned her eagerly, wrote down the name of
the Girondists, then added with a smile of triumph—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before a week, they shall have perished on the
guillotine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These words,” afterward said Charlotte, “sealed
his fate.” Drawing from beneath the handkerchief
which covered her bosom, the knife she had kept
there all along, she plunged it to the hilt in Marat’s
heart. He gave one loud expiring cry for help, and
sank back dead in the bath. By an instinctive impulse,
Charlotte had instantly drawn out the knife
from the breast of her victim, but she did not strike
again; casting it down at his feet, she left the closet
and sat down in a neighboring room, thoughtfully
passing her hand across her brow: her task was done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wife of Marat had rushed to his aid, on hearing
his cry for help. Laurent Basse, seeing that all
was over, turned round toward Charlotte, and with
a blow of a chair felled her to the floor, whilst the
infuriated Albertine trampled her under her feet.
The tumult aroused the other tenants of the house;
the alarm spread, and a crowd gathered in the apartment,
who learned with stupor that Marat, the Friend
of the People, had been murdered. Deeper still was
their wonder when they gazed on the murderess.
She stood there before them with still disordered
garments, and her disheveled hair, loosely bound by
a broad green ribbon, falling around her; but so
calm, so serenely lovely, that those who most abhorred
her crime gazed on her with involuntary admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was she then so beautiful?” was the question
addressed many years afterward, to on old man, one
of the few remaining witnesses of this scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful!” he echoed enthusiastically, adding
with the eternal regrets of old age: “Ay, there are
none such now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commissary of police began his interrogatory
in the saloon of Marat’s apartment. She told him her
name, how long she had been in Paris, confessed her
crime, and recognized the knife with which it had
been perpetrated. The sheath was found in her
pocket, with a thimble, some thread, money, and her
watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was your motive in assassinating Marat?”
asked the commissary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To prevent a civil war,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are your accomplices?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was ordered to be transferred to the Abbaye,
the nearest prison. An immense and infuriated
crowd had gathered around the door of Marat’s
house; one of the witnesses perceived that she
would have liked to be delivered to this maddened
multitude, and thus perish at once. She was not
saved from their hands without difficulty; her courage
failed her at the sight of the peril she ran, and
she fainted away on being conveyed to the fiacre.
On reaching the Abbaye, she was questioned until
midnight by Chabot and Drouet, two Jacobin members
of the convention. She answered their interrogatories
with singular firmness; observing, in conclusion:
“I have done my task, let others do
theirs.” Chabot threatened her with the scaffold;
she answered with a smile of disdain. Her behavior
until the 17th, the day of her trial, was marked by
the same firmness. She wrote to Barbaroux a
charming letter, full of graceful wit and heroic feeling.
Her playfulness never degenerated into levity:
like that of the illustrious Thomas Moore, it was the
serenity of a mind whom death had no power to
daunt. Speaking of her action, she observes—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I considered that so many brave men need not
come to Paris for the head of one man. He deserved
not so much honor: the hand of a woman was
enough.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have never hated but one being,
and him with what intensity I have sufficiently shown,
but there are a thousand whom I love still more
than I hated him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I confess that I employed
a perfidious artifice in order that he might receive
me. In leaving Caen, I thought to sacrifice him on
the pinnacle of ‘the mountain,’ but he no longer
went to it. In Paris, they cannot understand how a
useless woman, whose longest life could have been
of no good, could sacrifice herself to save her country.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
May peace be as soon established as I
desire! A great criminal has been laid low.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
the happiness of my country makes mine. A lively
imagination and a feeling heart promise but a stormy
life; I beseech those who might regret me to consider
this: they will then rejoice at my fate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tenderer tone marks the brief letter she addressed
to her father on the eve of her trial and
death:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, my dear father,” she observed, “for
having disposed of my existence without your permission.
I have avenged many innocent victims. I
have warded away many disasters. The people,
undeceived, will one day rejoice at being delivered
from a tyrant. If I endeavored to persuade you that
I was going to England, it was because I hoped to
remain unknown: I recognized that this was impossible.
I hope you will not be subjected to annoyance:
you have at least defenders at Caen; I
have chosen Gustave Doulcet de Pontecoulant for
mine: it is a mere matter of form. Such a deed allows
of no defense. Farewell, my dear father. I
beseech of you to forget me; or, rather, to rejoice at
my fate. I die for a good cause. I embrace my
sister, whom I love with my whole heart. Do not
forget the line of Corneille:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘Le crime faite la honte, et non pas l’échafaud.’</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>To-morrow, at eight, I am to be tried.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the morning of the 17th, she was led before her
judges. She was dressed with care, and had never
looked more lovely. Her bearing was so imposing
and dignified, that the spectators and the judges
seemed to stand arraigned before her. She interrupted
the first witness, by declaring that it was she
who had killed Marat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who inspired you with so much hatred against
him?” asked the president.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I needed not the hatred of others, I had enough
of my own,” she energetically replied. “Besides,
we do not execute well that which we have not ourselves
conceived.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, then, did you hate in Marat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His crimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think that you have assassinated all the
Marats?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but now that he is dead, the rest may
fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She answered other questions with equal firmness
and laconism. Her project, she declared, had been
formed since the 31st of May. “She had killed one
man to save a hundred thousand. She was a republican
long before the Revolution, and had never failed
in energy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you understand by energy?” asked the
president.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That feeling,” she replied, “which induces us to
cast aside selfish considerations, and sacrifice ourselves
for our country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fouquier Tinville here observed, alluding to the
sure blow she had given, that she must be well practiced
in crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The monster takes me for an assassin!” she exclaimed,
in a tone thrilling with indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This closed the debates, and her defender rose. It
was not Doulcet de Pontecoulant—who had not received
her letter—but Chauveau de la Garde, chosen
by the president. Charlotte gave him an anxious
look, as though she feared he might seek to save her
at the expense of honor. He spoke, and she perceived
that her apprehensions were unfounded. Without
excusing her crime or attributing it to insanity, he
pleaded for the fervor of her conviction; which he
had the courage to call sublime. The appeal proved
unavailing. Charlotte Corday was condemned.
Without deigning to answer the president, who
asked her if she had aught to object to the penalty
of death being carried out against her, she rose, and
walking up to her defender, thanked him gracefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These gentlemen,” said she, pointing to the
judges, “have just informed me that the whole of
my property is confiscated. I owe something in the
prison: as a proof of my friendship and esteem, I request
you to pay this little debt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On returning to the conciergerie, she found an artist,
named Hauer, waiting for her, to finish her portrait,
which he had begun at the tribunal. They
conversed freely together, until the executioner,
carrying the red chemise destined for assassins, and
the scissors with which he was to cut her hair off,
made his appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, so soon?” exclaimed Charlotte Corday,
slightly turning pale; but rallying her courage, she
resumed her composure, and presented a lock of her
hair to M. Hauer, as the only reward in her power
to offer. A priest came to offer her his ministry.
She thanked him and the persons by whom he had
been sent, but declined his spiritual aid. The executioner
cut her hair, bound her hands, and threw the
red chemise over her. M. Hauer was struck with
the almost unearthly loveliness which the crimson
hue of this garment imparted to the ill-fated maiden.
“This toilet of death, though performed by rude
hands, leads to immortality,” said Charlotte, with a
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A heavy storm broke forth as the car of the condemned
left the conciergerie for the Place de la Revolution.
An immense crowd lined every street
through which Charlotte Corday passed. Hootings
and execrations at first rose on her path; but as her
pure and serene beauty dawned on the multitude, as
the exquisite loveliness of her countenance, and the
sculptural beauty of her figure became more fully revealed,
pity and admiration superseded every other
feeling. Her bearing was so admirably calm and
dignified, as to rouse sympathy in the breasts of those
who detested not only her crime, but the cause for
which it had been committed. Many men of every
party took off their hats and bowed as the cart passed
before them. Amongst those who waited its approach,
was a young German, named Adam Luz, who stood
at the entrance of the Rue Sainte Honore, and followed
Charlotte to the scaffold. He gazed on the
lovely and heroic maiden with all the enthusiasm of
his imaginative race. A love, unexampled perhaps
in the history of the human heart, took possession of
his soul. Not one wandering look of “those beautiful
eyes, which revealed a soul as intrepid as it was
tender,” escaped him. Every earthly grace so soon
to perish in death, every trace of the lofty and immortal
spirit, filled him with bitter and intoxicating
emotions unknown till then. “To die for her; to
be struck by the same hand; to feel in death the
same cold axe which had severed the angelic head
of Charlotte; to be united to her in heroism, freedom,
love, and death, was now the only hope and
desire of his heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unconscious of the passionate love she had
awakened, Charlotte now stood near the guillotine.
She turned pale on first beholding it, but soon
resumed her serenity. A deep blush suffused her
face when the executioner removed the handkerchief
that covered her neck and shoulders, but she
calmly laid her head upon the block. The executioner
touched a spring, and the axe came down.
One of Samson’s assistants immediately stepped forward,
and holding up the lifeless head to the gaze of
the crowd, struck it on either cheek. The brutal act
only excited a feeling of horror; and it is said that—as
though even in death her indignant spirit protested
against this outrage—an angry and crimson flush
passed over the features of Charlotte Corday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days after her execution, Adam Luz published
a pamphlet, in which he enthusiastically
praised her deed, and proposed that a statue with the
inscription, “<span class='sc'>Greater than Brutus</span>,” should be
erected to her memory on the spot where she had
perished. He was arrested and thrown into prison.
On entering the Abbaye, he passionately exclaimed,
“I am going to die for her!” His wish was fulfilled
ere long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange, feverish times were those which could
rouse a gentle and lovely maiden to avenge freedom
by such a deadly deed; which could waken in a human
heart a love whose thoughts were not of life or
earthly bliss, but of the grave and the scaffold. Let
the times, then, explain those natures, where so
much evil and heroism are blended, that man cannot
mark the limits between both. Whatever judgment
may be passed upon her, the character of Charlotte
Corday was certainly not cast in an ordinary mould.
It is a striking and noble trait, that to the last she did
not repent: never was error more sincere. If she
could have repented, she would never have become
guilty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her deed created an extraordinary impression
throughout France. On hearing of it, a beautiful
royalist lady fell down on her knees, and invoked
“Saint Charlotte Corday.” The republican Madame
Roland calls her a heroine worthy of a better
age. The poet, Andre Chenier—who, before a year
had elapsed, followed her on the scaffold—sang her
heroism in a soul-stirring strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The political influence of that deed may be estimated
by the exclamation of Vergniaud: “She kills
us, but she teaches us how to die!” It was so.
The assassination of Marat exasperated all his
fanatic partisans against the Girondists. Almost divine
honors were paid to his memory; forms of
prayer were addressed to him; altars were erected
to his honor, and numberless victims sent to the
scaffold as a peace-offering to his manes. On the
wreck of his popularity rose the far more dangerous
power of Robespierre; a new impulse was given to
the Reign of Terror. Such was the “peace” which
the erring and heroic Charlotte Corday won for
France.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Golden Legend. By Henry Wordsworth Longfellow.
Boston: Ticknor, Read &amp; Fields. 1 vol. 16mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The readers of this charming poem, whatever may be
their judgment of its merits as compared with “The
Spanish Student” and “Evangeline,” will be compelled
to acknowledge its originality of plan, and the
new impression it conveys of the author’s genius.
Whatever it may be, it is most assuredly no repetition
of any of his former works, for the mark it leaves upon
the imagination is essentially novel. The poem is a succession
of highly colored pictures of life in the middle
ages; and though the fortunes of Prince Henry and Elsie
give a certain unity to the whole, it is a unity that admits
of more variety than “Evangeline”—a variety
which, though purchased at some expense of interest in
the story, produces a more pleasing impression in the
end. Though the poem has not the continuous richness
and warmth of fancy, diction, and melody which
commonly distinguish Longfellow’s writings, it is by no
means deficient in those qualities, and has scenes and
passages on which his imagination has expended the full
pomp of its luxurious images and subtle melodies.
Though filled with vivid pictures of the middle ages,
the poem can hardly be called picturesque, for the picturesque
implies not succession but combination; and
“The Golden Legend” is a succession of pictures, not
a combination of many into one. The picturesque, as
defined by Coleridge, is the “union, harmonious melting-down
and fusion of the different in kind and the disparate
in degree” and it is in this meaning of the word
that Coleridge denies the quality to Spenser, thereby
much puzzling even Hallam, who could not conceive
why a poem so full of pictures as the Faery Queene,
was not in an eminent degree picturesque.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The volume opens with a scene representing the spire
of the Strasburg Cathedral, and Lucifer with the Powers
of the Air, trying to tear down the cross. This scene
has a quaint sublimity which prepares the mind for the
strangeness of the representations of religion which
follow; for Longfellow, in his pictures of Catholicism,
presents it, not in its abstract doctrines, but in its concrete
life—presents it as it really existed in institutions,
customs, and men, during the middle ages. This idea
must be perceived at the commencement, or else the
reader, judging not merely as a modern Protestant, but
as a modern Catholic, will condemn the poem at once
as irreverently extravagant and bizarre. The next
scene introduces Prince Henry, sitting alone in his
castle, tormented with baffled aspiration and weariness
of life—a sort of Faust, but a Faust of sentiment rather
than a Faust of intellect. In a beautiful soliloquy, the
prince mourns over the graves of his departed hopes,
loves, and aspirations, in a style very different from the
sharp, short, electric curses on the deceptions of life,
which leap from the lips of Goethe’s hero. We give a
short extract, which is a poem in itself:</p>

<p class='noindent'>Lucifer appears, in his accustomed dress as a traveling
physician, and accompanied by his usual sign, a flash of

<p class='pindent'>We are next transferred as spectators to the courtyard
of the castle, and a most beautiful scene occurs
between Hubert, Prince Henry’s seneschal, and Walter,
the Minnesinger, a capital embodiment of the knightly
poet of the middle ages. The prince, it seems, has relapsed
from the glory of his exaltation, has become more
soul-sick than ever, has fallen under the malediction of
the church; and has gone forth into disgrace and banishment.
We give the concluding passage of this scene,
where Walter speaks of the “beings of the wind” that
attend the poet, and, leaning over the parapet of the
castle, describes the landscape:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pictures which follow of Gottlieb, his wife Ursula,
and Elsie, his daughter, the heroine of the poem, are
beautiful and touching representations of the sturdy
honesty and sublime simplicity of faith, which distinguished
the religious German peasant-family of the
old time. A legend of the Monk Felix, which Prince
Henry reads, while Elsie is gathering flowers for him
and for St. Cecelia, is truly “golden.” We cannot resist
the temptation to quote a portion of it.</p>

<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>A volume of Saint Augustine,</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>Wherein he read of the unseen,</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>Splendors of God’s great town</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>In the unknown land,</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>And, with his eyes cast down</p>

<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>The sudden singing of a bird,</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>A snow-white bird, that from a cloud</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>Dropped down,</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>And among the branches brown</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>Sat singing</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>So sweet, and clear, and loud,</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>It seemed a thousand harp-strings ringing.</p>

<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>With rapturous look,</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>He listened to the song,</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>And hardly breathed or stirred,</p>

<p class='pindent'>A large portion of the rest of the poem is devoted to
representations of the cities, towns, forests through
which they pass on their way to Salerno, the cloisters
and convents where they stop, and the many-colored
and multiform life with which they come slightly in contact
or collision. The thread of the story is here spun
very fine, and we almost lose memory of the hero and
heroine, while rapt in the gorgeous pictures of medieval
superstition, manners and character, with which the
page is crowded. It is evident that the story itself is
too slight for the bulk of the book, and that the majority
of the scenes, vivid and delightful as they are in themselves,
have not that vital connection with the chief
characters and leading event which is demanded in a
work of art. And yet, if the reader sharply scrutinizes
the whole impression which the poem leaves on his
imagination, he will, perhaps, discover that there is a
fine thread of union connecting the various parts, and
that the incidents and scenery of the journey have not
that merely mechanical juxtaposition which characterizes
the events and scenes recorded in a tourist’s
journal. The prince and Elsie are felt when they are
not seen; and we do not know but that the poem may
awake the admiration of future critics for the singular
refinement of the imaginative power, by which the
seemingly heterogeneous parts of the work are subtly
organized into a homogeneous whole, by the connection
of the profound Catholic sentiment of Elsie with the
other expressions, grotesque and besotted, of the operation
of the same faith. But such refinements are foreign
to our purpose here. It is sufficient to say that the
prince and Elsie appear at least on the edges of all the
incidents which are so vividly presented. At the conclusion,
the prince repents just as Elsie is on the point
of being immolated, and then finds that his health recovers
more rapidly on the prospect that she will live
for him, instead of die for him. They are accordingly
married. The account of the return to the cottage of
Gottlieb and the castle of the prince, is very beautiful.
Elsie is, perhaps, Longfellow’s finest creation, representing
a woman so perfectly good, that her principles
have become instincts. The devil that appears in the
book, though sufficiently Satanic to frighten some sensitive
readers, is rather a languid Lucifer, as compared
with Milton’s or Goethe’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the many curiosities of the poem is a play,
ingeniously imitated, in form and spirit, from those
monstrosities of the early drama, the Miracle Plays.
The fourth part is devoted to a convent in the Black
Forest, and the soliloquy of Friar Claus, in the wine-cellar—of
Friar Pacificus, transcribing and illuminating
MSS.—of the Abbot Ernestus, pacing among the
cloisters—and the convivial scene in the rectory—are
fine descriptions of cloistered life, true both to the ideas
and facts of the time. The passionate confession of
the Abbess Irmingard to Elsie, is in Longfellow’s most
powerful style, and has a fire and fierceness of outright
and downright passion, not common to his representations
of emotion. All of these would afford many choice
passages for quotation; we have but room, however,
for Friar Cuthbert’s sermon, delivered in front of the
Strasburg Cathedral, on Easter Day. This, with a
quaint audacity of its own, elbows out even its betters
in verse and sentiment, and vehemently claims the right
to be cited:</p>

<p class='pindent'>We think we have sufficiently quoted from this delightful
volume to give our readers an idea of its poetical
merit. But no analysis or quotation can do justice to
the wealth of knowledge it evinces of the middle ages,
and to the various scholarship it displays. Longfellow,
with a true poetic insight and power of assimilation, has
given us here the life and spirit as well as the form of a
by-gone age, so that the reader of the poem can obtain
more of the substance of knowledge from its pictured
page than from history itself. The work is not only one
of uncommon poetical excellence, but it is a triumph
over difficulties inherent in the subject, and over the
subjective limitations of the author’s own mind. It is
broader if not higher than any thing he has previously
written, promises to be more permanently popular, and
has the great merit of increasing in the reader’s estimation
with a second or even a third perusal.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Miscellanies. By the Rev. James Martineau. Boston:
Crosby &amp; Nichols. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Martineau has long been known to a numerous
class of readers in this country as an eloquent preacher
and essayist. The present volume is composed of philosophical
essays, selected from his contributions to the
Westminster and Prospective Reviews, and is edited by
the Rev. Thomas S. King, of Boston, himself one of the
most eloquent and accomplished of New England clergymen.
Mr. Martineau’s sermons have been repeatedly
reprinted, but this volume of Miscellanies conveys an
impression of the independence and fertility of his mind
and the reach of his acquisitions, which his sermons,
with all their peculiar merit, would never give. It
evinces not only an interest in all the social and religious
problems which puzzle the present age, but a grasp of
scholarship extending far back over the philosophies and
literatures of other times and nations. The bent of his
nature, however, is toward mental hospitality to the
radical opinions of the day, and new thoughts, new
hopes, even new paradoxes, are ever welcomed by his
heart and disposition when his cool head doubts, discusses,
demurs, and withholds its assenting judgment.
He seems to have more sympathy for reformers than
their productions, as his rich and various culture enables
him to detect one-sidedness or superficiality in many
a plan of amelioration, the spirit of which he approves.
Both, however, in politics and religion he would be
classed with the extremely “liberal” party; and though
the conservative elements of his mind are, to a discriminating
reader, visible in almost every page of the present
volume, the author appears all the while desirous to
share the glorious unpopularity of a class of thinkers
with whom he but imperfectly sympathizes rather than
to indicate his points of disagreement with their schemes
and systems. He has a deep mental disgust for the moral
timidity and intellectual feebleness which characterize
so many of the fashionable and conventional thinkers on
politics and theology, and is perhaps from this cause too
apt to overlook defects in heretical systems in his admiration
of the courage of the heretics. In his own
words, “it is a dishonorable characteristic of the present
age, that on its most marked intellectual tendencies is
impressed a character of <span style='font-size:smaller'>FEAR</span>. While its great practical
agitations exhibit a progress toward some positive
and attainable good, all its conspicuous movements of
thought seem to be retreats from some apprehended evil.
The open plain of meditation, over which, in simpler
times, earnest men might range with devout and unmolested
hope, bristles all over with directions showing
which way we are <span class='it'>not</span> to go. Turn where we may
we see warnings to beware of some sophist’s pitfall,
or devil’s ditch, or fool’s paradise, or atheist’s
desert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This “despair of truth,” this intellectual cowardice,
is more offensive to Mr. Martineau than unbelief itself.
He describes the class of thinkers he most dislikes in
one sentence of beautiful sharpness. “Checked and
frightened,” he says, “at the entrance of every path on
which they venture, they <span class='it'>spend their strength in standing
still</span>; or devise ingenious proofs, that, in a world where
periodicity is the only progress, retrogradation is the
discreetest method of advance.” His whole volume is
therefore a protest against the practice, common both in
England and the United States, of erecting in the republic
of thought a despotism of dullness and timidity, by
which independent investigation is to be allowed only so
far as it results in fortifying accredited systems, and a
bounty is put on that worst form of disbelief, infidelity
to the laws of thought, the monitions of conscience, and
the beckonings of new and inspiring truths. But while
he is properly angry at such noodleism as this, which,
if unlashed and unrebuked, would reduce men of thought
into a corporation of intellectual Jerry Sneaks, he does
not appear to us properly to distinguish between that
independence which seeks truth and that independence
which is merely a blustering egotism, and ostentatious
exhibition of the commonplaces of error. His discrimination
is not always of that sort which detects through
the verbal disguises of moral energy the unmistakable
features of moral pertness. The charlatans of dignity
and convention have provoked a corresponding clique of
charlatans, who revel in the bravadoes of license and
anarchy; and it is no part of a wise man’s duty to allow
his disgust of one form of nonsense to tempt him into
championship of another form, because it happens to be
on the opposite extreme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defect of Mr. Martineau’s nature appears to be the
dominion of the reflective portion of his nature over all
its other powers. He is emphatically a thinker, but a
thinker on subjects so allied to sentiment and passion,
that some action should be combined with it, in order
that the mind shall receive no morbid taint, be not
“sicklied o’er” by a thought that broadens into unpractical
comprehension. The fertility of his mind in
thoughts is altogether out of proportion to the vigor of
his nature, and though intellectually brave he is not intellectually
robust. Hence a lack of muscle and nerve
in his most beautiful paragraphs; hence the absence of
electric force and condensed energy of expression in his
finest statements; hence a certain sadness and languor
in the atmosphere spread over his writings, the breathing
of which does not invigorate the mind so much as it enlarges
its view. He communicates thoughts, but he does
not always communicate the inspiration to think.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although these drawbacks prevent us from ranking
him, as a writer, in the highest class—for a writer of the
highest class impresses his readers by the force of his
character as much as by the affluence of his conceptions
and the beauties of his style—still Mr. Martineau ranks
high among contemporary prose writers for the sweetness,
clearness, pliancy and unity of his style, his happy
felicities of imagery, his unostentatious intellectual honesty,
and his command of all the rhetorical aids of
metaphor, sarcasm and figurative illustration. His style
is also strictly vital, the exact expression of his nature
as well as opinions; but its melody is flute-like rather
than clarion-like; is so consistently ornate and so tuned
on one key, that commonplaces and originalities are
equally clad in the same superb uniform, and move to the
music of the same slow march; and the sad earnestness
and languor, which we have mentioned as characterizing
his will, steal mysteriously out from his exquisite
periods, and pass into the reader’s mind like an invisible
essence. Almost every professor of rhetoric would say
that Mr. Martineau is a better writer than the Bishop of
Exeter, a church dignitary for whom Mr. Martineau’s
liberal mind has a natural antipathy. Mr. Martineau
has evidently a larger command of words and images,
more taste, more toleration, more intellectual conscientiousness
and comprehension, a better metaphysician, a
more trustworthy thinker, with less mosaic work in his
logic, and less casuistry in his ethics. But behind all
the Bishop of Exeter’s sentences is a great, brawny,
hard-fisted, pugilistic, arrogant <span class='it'>man</span>, daring, confident,
indomitable, with as much will as reason, and with all
his opinions so thoroughly penetrated with the life-blood
of his character that they have all the force of bigotry
and prejudice. He is equally unreasonable and uncreative
as a thinker, but his unreason has a vigor that Mr.
Martineau’s reason lacks. Wielding with his strong
arm some piece of medieval bigotry, he goes crashing
on from sentence to sentence, angrily pummeling and
buffeting his opponents—a theological “ugly customer,”
who, when the rush of his coming is heard afar
off, makes the adversaries he is approaching glance instinctively
to the direction—“look out for the engine
when the bell rings!” Mr. Martineau’s large understanding
would be benefited by some of the Bishop’s
will; and one is driven to the conclusion, that, a man of
purely independent thought, who abides in conceptions
of his own, entirely apart from authority, must be a
genius of the first order to escape from that weakness of
will which distinguishes the most adventurous of Mr.
Martineau’s abstract and uninvigorating speculations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, in all declamations about the advantages of
strict individualism in matters of faith and speculation,
there is not the right emphasis laid on the distinction
between abstract and concrete ideas. A faith which
rests on some union of authority with reason, which is
connected with institutions, which combines the principle
of obedience with that of liberty, may be narrow but
it is sure to be strong, and if not distinguished by reach
of thought will compensate for that deficiency by force
of character. Mr. Martineau’s tendency is to the abstract,
the impalpable, the unrealized in speculation,
and spends much of his strength in supporting himself
at the elevation of his thought. But as his thinking is
not on the level of his character, he insensibly exalts
opinion over life, and is more inclined to tolerate the excesses
of unbridled and unreasonable egotism, than the
prejudices of pious humility. As a thinker his mind demands
breadth and largeness of view, and we hardly
think he could be satisfied with a saint who was not
something of a philosopher. But while he has a literary
advantage over his adversaries, they have a personal
advantage over him. In courage, even, there can be
little doubt that the Bishop of Exeter is his superior, for
all the coarser human elements which enter into courage
Mr. Martineau lacks. Mr. Martineau has the courage
to deny in his Review any proposition which any established
church might proclaim; but he could not have
assailed the Archbishop of Canterbury, and bearded
Lord Campbell, like the bishop. The difference in the
case is, that the bishop battled for a positive institution
around which for years his affections and passions had
clustered; while Mr. Martineau has no such inspiration
to support the abstract conclusions of his intellect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subjects of the essays in this volume are Dr.
Priestley, Dr. Arnold, Church and State, Theodore
Parker’s Discourses of Religion, Phases of Faith, The
Church of England, and the Battle of the Churches. Of
these we have been particularly impressed with the
analysis of the mental character of Priestley, the review
of Mr. Parker, and the articles relating to the English
Church. The essay on Dr. Arnold has something of the
some merit which distinguishes that on Dr. Priestley; it
is acute in the examination of principles but dull in the
perception of character. Mr. Martineau is always
strong in the explication of ideas and the statement and
analysis of systems, but he constantly overlooks men in
his attention to the opinions they champion and represent.
The dramatic element not only does not exist in
his mind, but he hardly accepts it as a possibility of the
human intellect; and therefore he always fails in viewing
ideas in connection with the individuality or nationality
in which they have their root, and is accordingly
often unintentionally intolerant to persons from his want
of insight into the individual conditions of their intellectual
activity. But we gladly hasten from these criticisms
on his limitations to some examples of his peculiar
merits as a writer. In speaking of Dr. Priestley’s intellectual
processes as a scientific explorer and discoverer,
he shrewdly remarks: “He was the ample collector of
materials for discovery rather than the final discoverer
himself; a sign of approaching order rather than the
producer of order himself. We remember an amusing
German play, designed as a satire upon the philosophy
of atheism, in which Adam walks across the stage, going
to be created; and, though a paradox, it may be said that
truth, as it passed through Dr. Priestley’s mind, was
going to be created.” In referring to the purely independent
action of Dr. Priestley’s mind in the formation
of his opinions, our analyst gives a fine statement of the
real sources of most men’s “positive” knowledge and
doctrines. “It would be difficult,” he says, “to select
from the benefactors of mankind one who was less acted
upon by his age; whose convictions were more independent
of sympathy; in the whole circle of whose
opinions you can set down so little to the prejudgments
of education, to the attractions of friendship, to the perverse
love of opposition, to the contagion of prevailing
taste, or to any of the irregular moral causes which,
independently of evidence, determine the course of
human belief.” Again, how fine is his statement of the
indestructibility of Christian faith: “Amid the vicissitudes
of intellect, worship retains its stability; and the
truth, which, it would seem, cannot be proved, is unaffected
by an infinite series of refutations. How evident
that it has its ultimate seat, not in the mutable judgments
of the understanding, but in the native sentiments
of Conscience and the inexhaustible aspirations of Affection!
The Supreme certainly must needs be too true
to be proved: and the highest perfection can appear
doubtful only to sensualism and sin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Battle of the Churches,” the most exquisite in
thought and style of all the essays in the volume, and
well-known to most readers for its clear statement of
the hold which Romanism has upon the affections of
mankind, contains many examples of the fine irony and
bland sarcasm which enter into the more stimulating ingredients
of Mr. Martineau’s softly flowing diction. His
statement of Comte’s Law of Progression, as followed
by his view of the complicated theological discussions
which now divide England into furious parties, is most
demurely comical. “In 1822,” he commences, “a
French philosopher discovered the grand law of human
progression, revealed it to applauding Paris, brought the
history of all civilized nations to pronounce it infallible,
and computed from it the future course of European society.
The mind of man, we are assured by Auguste
Comte, passes by invariable necessity through three
stages of development: the state of religion, or fiction;
of metaphysics, or abstract thought; of science, or positive
knowledge. No change in this order, no return upon
its steps, is possible; the shadow cannot retreat upon the
dial, or the man return to the nature of the child. Every
one who is not behind the age will tell you, that he has
outlived the theology of his infancy and the philosophy
of his youth, to settle down on a physical belief in the
ripeness of his powers. And so, too, the world, passing
from myth to metaphysics, and from metaphysics to induction,
begins with the Bible and ends with the ‘<span class='it'>Cours
de Philosophie Positive</span>.’ To the schools of the prophets
succeeds ‘<span class='it'>L’Ecole Polytechnique</span>;’ and our intellect,
having surmounted the meridians of God and the Soul,
culminates in the apprehension of material nature.
Henceforth the problems so intensely attractive to speculation,
and so variously answered by faith, retire from
the field of thought. They have an interest, as in some
sense the autobiography of an adolescent world: but
they were never to return in living action upon the
earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We can only, in conclusion, recommend to our readers
an examination of this volume, and to its editor a continuation
of his well-rewarded labors in Mr. Martineau’s
mine.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Women of Early Christianity. A Series of Portraits,
with appropriate Descriptions, by several American
Clergymen. Edited by Rev. J. A. Spencer, M. A.
New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1 vol. 8vo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This magnificent volume, with its superb illustrations,
letter-press and binding, seems to have been published
with a determination to rival those English houses who
supply the American market with splendid gift-books.
It contains seventeen ideal portraits, engraved from
original designs for this work, and conveying all the
varieties of expression which religious emotion communicates
to the human countenance, from the humblest
penitence to loftiest rapture. The notices are by the
editor, assisted by Dr. Sprague, Dr. Kip, Dr. Ingen, Dr.
Parks, the Rev. Mr. Osgood, and a few other eminent
clergymen. The volume will be found especially interesting
to those who delight in whatever increases their
knowledge of the manners and the character, the sufferings
and the heroic resolution of the early Christians.
The lives of these women is a representation of Christianity
as embodied in feminine character; and the study
is curious in its metaphysical as well as its theological
aspect. Among the best of the communicated articles,
is that of St. Agnes, by Mr. Osgood. The conclusion
we quote for the pointedness of its application. “To
us,” says Mr. Osgood, “this Roman girl stands as a
sacred ideal of the Christian maiden. Her name we may
not invoke in prayer. Her purity and heroism we may
admire and commend to the honor of the maidens of our
time, who are tempted by powers more insidious than
the arts and threats of Sempronius. The world has not
changed its heart so much as its creed and costume. Its
corrupt fashions would tyrannize over our daughters
with the pride of the Cæsars, and a meretricious literature
lurks in our journals and romances more dangerous
to maidenly purity than the den of shame which assailed
only to illustrate the virtue of Agnes. True to her soul
and to her Saviour, the Christian maiden wins to her
brow a radiance which, instead of being dimmed by
marriage, is rather brightened by the affections of the
wife and the sacrifices of the mother, into the aureola
of the saint.”</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Greenwood Leaves. A Collection of Sketches and Letters.
By Grace Greenwood. Second Series. Boston: Ticknor,
Reed &amp; Fields. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This series of sketches is superior to the first, and indicates
plainly, not only the growth of the author’s
mind, but a firmer and more confident grasp and control
of her various resources of intellect, sentiment and acquisition.
It is the production of the same individuality
which gave zest to her first volume, but an individuality
of larger moral and mental stature. The full, easy, almost
majestic flow of emotion and sentiment, which
gave vividness to the conceptions and vigorous movement
to the style of her former sketches, is visible here
in a brighter and more powerful form; and, it may be
added, that the faults proceeding from the intensity of
her mind, and her custom of surveying things which
properly claim the decision of judgment through an atmosphere
of feeling, are not altogether absent from her
present work. She exaggerates both in her praise and
blame; her eulogy being too generous, her condemnation
sometimes too sharp and indiscriminating; and many of
her criticisms are, therefore, but an ingenious and splendid
exhibition of likes and dislikes, rather than a record
of intellectual judgments. She has not yet obtained the
faculty of viewing things as they are in themselves, independent
of the feelings they excite in her own soul.
This fault is a source of raciness, and doubtless makes
her books all the more stimulating to a majority of
renders; but it would seem that a mind which gives such
unmistakable hints of sharp insight, penetrating wit, and
clear, intuitive reason as Grace Greenwood’s, should
keep the enthusiasm of her nature a little more under
control; and this could be done, we opine, without
breaking up into waves and ripples that superb sweep
of her prose style, which is her great charm as a writer.
We may add that the Letters in this volume, especially
those from Washington, have often a delightful combination
of observation, wit and fancy, and in their rambling
references to individuals, almost raise gossip to the
dignity of a fine art.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'><a id='mob'></a>Moby-Dick; or The Whale. By Herman Melville.
New York: Harper and Brothers. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This volume sparkles with the raciest qualities of the
author’s voluble and brilliant mind, and whatever may
be its reception among old salts, it will be sure of success
with the reading public generally. It has passages
of description and narration equal to the best that Melville
has written, and its rhetoric revels and riots in
scenes of nautical adventure with more than usual glee
and gusto. The style is dashing, headlong, strewn with
queer and quaint ingenuities moistened with humor, and
is a capital specimen of deliberate and felicitous recklessness,
in which a seeming helter-skelter movement is
guided by real judgment. The whole work beams with
the analogies of a bright and teeming fancy—a faculty
that Melville possesses in such degree that it sometimes
betrays his rhetoric into fantastic excesses, and gives a
sort of unreality to his most vivid descriptions. The
joyous vigor and elasticity of his style, however, compensate
for all faults, and even his tasteless passages
bear the impress of conscious and unwearied power.
His late books are not only original in the usual sense,
but evince originality of nature, and convey the impression
of a new individuality, somewhat composite, it is
true, but still giving to the jaded reader of every-day
publications, that pleasant shock of surprise which
comes from a mental contact with a character at once
novel and vigorous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This volume, one of the most sumptuous in external

a book of travels. Dr. Wainwright is both an eager and
acute observer, and his volume bears continual evidence

his disregard of discomfort and danger, and his desire to
see with his own eyes what any eyes had seen. The
book is full of information, much of which is valuable, and
all of which is entertaining. The illustrations, twenty-eight
in number, are exceedingly well executed, and are
important aids to the author’s descriptions. The volume
is one of the most elegant that ever the Appletons have

<p class='pindent'>The author of this valuable volume is a man of education
and intelligence, who gives us the results of his
observations and experience during sixteen months of
practical mining, and who, as having written the most
sensible book on the subject, deserves to have his facts
and opinions carefully studied by every man who meditates
a California journey. The extravagant expectations
formed by most emigrants have been miserably
baulked by the stern realities of the case, and the plain
facts given by Mr. Woods will, we hope, induce the adventurous
portion of the public to pause and reflect
before they undertake an enterprise whose common
result is four dollars a day, and broken health, instead of
a fortune.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.3em;font-weight:bold;'>Held in his idle moments, with his Readers, Correspondents and Exchanges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reader! we have determined to be more familiar
with you. We shall talk right at you, in defiance of
any over nice rules. If you like us, we shall have much
to say to you—telling plain truths in our own off-hand
way, and occasionally giving you a punch in the ribs
with our fore-finger, by way of impressment. <span class='it'>Our</span>
punch, however, is “our own peculiar”—with but little
acid—and may be taken in moderation, without fear of
a headache from its excessive strength. It is new, and
though not as heady as the imported, it costs us no pains
of conscience by way of unpaid duties. Like the old
lady’s gingerbread, “it costs nothing to make, for the
molasses is already in the house.” So you may make a
meal on ours, and spices being hot, you will find yourself
comfortable without a bear-skin. Indeed we hope
to make “vituals and drink and pretty good clothes” out
of it ourself, and to be vulgar and quote a proverb,
“What is fat for the goose <span class='it'>ought</span> to be fat for the
gander.” So you see you are in for a living as long as
you read “Graham.” But whether a person of robust
constitution could survive long on the viands that are
served up at some of the other magazine tables, is a
question more in the line of another Graham to answer—who
has invented a bran new way of growing gracefully
stout, on the shadow of cabbages, by a process of
“small by degrees and beautifully less.” It is expected
that any fellow who comes to our table shall
smoke his cigar, and laugh with the rest of the company,
and not mar the general hilarity by looking grave
(? stupid) and asking when the fun is over—“What is it

out in meeting about Church, for he was an associate of
ours in Auld Lang Syne—in a daily paper—and we
know him. His modest, gentlemanly demeanor conceals
a world of honest good stuff, of which a dozen

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Arthur’s Home Gazette.</span>—We call the attention

Journal; and we do it with the more heartiness as we
have known its editor intimately for many years, and
have known him as one of the most upright, consistent,
laborious, talented, yet modest of our literary men.
Mr. Arthur is an earnest, good man—practically the
moral editor he pretends to be—there is no sham or
flummery in his composition, but truthful and fearless,
he conducts his Journal as much as a matter of conscience,
as a matter of dollars. He is totally free, too,
of all small jealousies of other people’s success—but with
a keen eye to life and its surroundings, he attends rigidly
to his own concerns, and labors to embody his observations
and experiences, so as to make men wiser and
better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To his well-known ability as an author, Mr. Arthur
unites the rare gift of a capital writer for a journal, seizing
with happy tact upon the passing occurrences of the
hour, and so combining them with his own manly reflections
as to give us just views of life and of its responsibilities,
too, at the same glance. In the management of
his journal Mr. A. has had the sagacity to enlist brains—the
best writers are among his regular contributors,
and without any parade or pretence, he quietly issues
his sheet each week, teeming with thought, and overflowing
with the generous sentiments of a thorough
Christian gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If any of our readers desire to see a copy of the Gazette,

to subscribe they can have this Magazine and that
paper for $4. We have spoken frankly of Mr. Arthur

tell the whole truth at once, without attempting to throw
dust in people’s eyes about extra pages when there are
none—or new fashions, which are but copies of old
French designs—American literature contributed by
English and Swedish writers, or by Mrs. Hall, an Irish
lady. Jonathan is not as stupid as he looks, and we
doubt whether there is much <span class='it'>made</span> in attempting to cheat
him. So here’s into the confessional—Jontey, my boy,
the plate called “Sweet Sixteen,” in this number, was
not engraved for Graham—and you will observe he does
not say it was—but it cost us $120 for all that, on account
of its beauty. If you have never seen it, you will like
it much—if you have, go one eye on it from an original
point of view, and refresh your admiration—that’s a
good boy! If that engraving don’t suit you, look at
Père-la-Chaise, which we paid Rolph, of New York,
$175 for engraving; or admire Devereux’s fine wood-engravings.
Then take up the literary department and

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Froth of Small Beer.</span>—One word as to the
sly hits at us for engaging “Mr. James, an English
writer.” Well! Mr. James <span class='it'>is</span> a writer of English, and
notwithstanding the gnat-like buzzing of small critics
who singe their wings in his light, we think him one of
the most agreeable of all novel writers. He is a gentleman,
of modest demeanor, who does not come to this
country to raise a hurrah, or a row, by flattering our
vanity or assailing our foibles. He has settled snugly
down on his farm at Stockbridge, Massachusetts—claims
the proper protection of his property as a resident
citizen, by copyrighting his books; and attends quietly
to his own affairs. We paid him $1200 for his novel,
and think it a good one—he is satisfied—we are satisfied—and
the readers of Graham are delighted. So that we
hope to survive the small malice of small men. If Graham
lives, he will, before he closes the year 1852, have
the largest list of good paying subscribers that ever
blessed a publisher’s eyes with the sight of dollars, and
will show such energy <span class='it'>in</span> “Graham” as will astonish
those who imitate, but can never excel, and whose
highest achievement it is, to be looking through a piece
of smoked glass, in the vain hope of seeing an eclipse of
Graham’s Magazine.</p>

<hr class='tbk159'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Always 112 Pages.</span>—At the risk of being thought a
little malicious, as well as prophetical, we ask of our
readers, and of editors with whom we exchange, to compare
the quantity of literary matter in Graham of this
month, with those who endeavor to follow in our footsteps
with the January number, but trip up, or get leg-weary
as soon as the number is published, and the <span class='it'>subscriptions</span>
are received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We also ask—and in this we do <span class='it'>not</span> think we are impertinent,
that our editorial friends will, in so far as
their leisure will permit, look over Graham before noticing
it, even if the notice be delayed a week or more.
We are in no expiring agony or apprehension that we are
forgotten by our exchanges—so we can wait their pleasure
about the notice always; and should prefer a candid
expression of sentiment, favorable or adverse, to any
solicited puffery. Indeed, it would be refreshing to be
scored up a little or quizzed once in a while. Only if
you have but <span class='it'>a word</span> or <span class='it'>a line</span>, to say of Graham, don’t
bundle him into a bag with any body! He comes to your
table by invitation—so give him his own plate and knife
and fork; and if you treat him to but plain fare, he will
be as jolly as if you champagned him, or killed the fattest
chicken, in your desire to honor his visit with a barbecue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our readers, of course, <span class='it'>read</span> “Graham”—they can <span class='it'>tell</span>
their acquaintances what a happy rascal he is, and how
much they miss it by not having him drop in upon them
these long winter evenings. Will you do this?—each
<span class='it'>one</span> of you—<span style='font-size:smaller'>YOU</span>!</p>

<hr class='tbk160'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>A New Feature.</span>—In addition to, and separate from,
the regular review of new books, we shall introduce a
new feature in “Graham”—that of giving well-chosen
chapters of new books—bound volumes which do not
readily find their way into a large circulation—that our
readers, far and near, may be kept <span class='it'>booked</span> up in all that
appertains to the fresh literature of the day. In this
number, we give a short chapter from Ik Marvel’s new
work—“Dream-Land”—and in subsequent numbers of
“Graham,” shall devote some eight or ten pages to interesting
and sparkling chapters or passages of choice
and rare volumes, the proof sheets of which we can often
obtain in advance. The great addition to <span class='it'>the size</span> of the
Magazine, readily affords us space for this improvement—and
if our readers receive but half the gratification
which we design to impart to them by this new feature,
Graham will be amply rewarded.</p>

<hr class='tbk161'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Home Journal.</span>—One of the most delightful of
all the journals we have upon our exchange—and they
number <span class='it'>over twelve hundred</span>—is the Home Journal of
New York, Edited by N. Parker Willis and George P.
Morris, two men whose <span class='it'>names</span> are household words, and
whose fine genius seems to expand in its sparkling pages.
There is no paper in the country upon which there is
such manifest employment of brain-work or pains-taking
labor—of tact or taste. The editorial page alone will
furnish food, at any time, for a day of pleasant reflection—the
whole sheet, indeed, is the siftings of golden sand.
It is a sort of intellectual placer, where Beauty may grow
radiant and wise.</p>

<hr class='tbk162'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Liberal.</span>—Duval, of The Phœnix, Camden, Ala.,
offers to exchange his Weekly with the Daily of the
Boston Post, provided Green will publish his prospectus
<span class='it'>six times</span>. If Green declines that offer he don’t deserve
his name. Duval has a fair hit at the catch-penny affairs
which offer to give an exchange and an “engraving,”
(? wood-cut) as a premium to those who publish a two-column
prospectus and get up a club.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is about time the country press took this matter in
hand. We send “Graham” to whom we please, and if
noticed—well, if not—weller. We shall not die out
from exhaustion if an editor with whom we exchange
fails to say that Graham <span class='it'>is</span>, or is not, “himself again”.</p>

<hr class='tbk163'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Welcome Brother.</span>—We welcome to the corps
editorial of the Magazine fraternity, John Sartain, Esq.,
who, with all the blushing honors thick upon him as an
artist of the first ability, comes like another Alexander
to conquer in a new field. We have confidence in Mr.
Sartain’s tact and taste, and look for a very fresh, sparkling
and original periodical. Mr. S. is a disciple of the
doctrine of progress—“<span class='it'>onward!</span>” is his motto—though
all the fiends oppose. He is a revolutionizer, and has
commenced <span class='it'>cutting</span> the heads off in style. We don’t
want to take off any thing in Sartain, but if he can
“keep it up” long, he must get a new bat-man for his
Puck’s port-folio—not even a Puck could <span class='it'>stand</span> that.</p>

<hr class='tbk164'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Wont Do It.</span>—The State Guard of Wetumpka,
Ala., “hopes George R. will forgive it, for lending
“Graham” to six young ladies.” The sin is unpardonable.
Look you—Messrs. Hardy and Stephens! what
right have you to be making love to half a dozen pretty
girls? Where are their beaux, that each of them has
not a “Graham” of her own? Inquire into this business,
and report at the next meeting. No young lady
has a right to read “Graham” unless her beau pays the
damage.</p>

<hr class='tbk165'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Godey</span> will find it impossible to get the Mote out of
his own eye, when he contrasts “Sweet Sixteen” in
this number with his Americanized Fashion plates,
Our own have a beam of pleasure in them, as we gaze
upon its surpassing loveliness. The original <span class='it'>must be</span> a
beauty. We have never seen her—indeed, should never
have had this copy, were it not for <span class='it'>a</span> heart in the business,
loading us to brave all dangers to conquer.</p>

<hr class='tbk166'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Robert Morris</span>, of the Inquirer, is a friend that
never wavers, but in sunshine or in storm, his benignant
countenance and cheering words are never wanting
Morris must have a rich treasury in the memory of good
deeds done—of kindly words spoken in dark hours to
the sad and desolate—a wealth of remembrance of generous
hours, worth all the gold of misers.</p>

<hr class='tbk167'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Acknowledged.</span>—Godey had the most beautiful cover
on his Magazine for January that we have ever seen.
Having beaten him in our Paris Fashion, we submit and
are penitent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall start a bank with Godey on the profits of our
January numbers—notes to be kept at par for thirty
days. There is no joke in this—it is as serious as Sartain’s
fun.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Curious, Isn’t?</span>—They intend, in Kentucky, to
blacken the <span class='it'>noses</span> of all convicts, so that if they escape,
they may be detected. Pike, of the Flag, suggests that
the operation be extended to all delinquent subscribers
to periodicals and newspapers—he <span class='it'>knows</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Graham lays down and expounds the law as it <span class='it'>ought

Printer” who was bred in “Alexander’s time,” has, by
eating a good deal of it, become a hero in ours—and survived
the decay which usually attaches itself to mortals
who press “the rugged pathway up the steeps of Fame.”
He lives on air—or at least on that <span class='it'>fast</span> press which
came off with a feed at the Astor. Hoeing his own row
most elegantly, he disdains in ’52 the mean competition
of trade, which leads men to haggle for sixpence profit,
but becomes a prophet himself, and carries out his own
predictions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scott, last year, having announced a sheet “as big as

Berks—was accused of endeavoring to pull down the
whole literary temple, like another Sampson—of proceeding
at a gait that would not pay, and of throwing
dust in people’s eyes, who were expected to go it blind.
The charge was a plain one—being delivered by people
who use the plain language—the inclined plane—and
Scott, who having lived “in Alexander’s time,” had
opportunities to observe that people who play with
“edged tools,” however expert, are apt to suffer from

path when he was younger. It is astonishing how popular
Magazine publishers are when they are young! But
Godey has been “<span class='it'>a publisher</span> for twenty-two years!”
<span class='it'>Shocking!</span> Yet there is consolation in this, too, for
some of the Magazines will never be able to imitate
Godey in that “feature”—we’ll bet a “dollar” on’t.</p>

<hr class='tbk185'/>

<p class='pindent'>If people will say handsome things of “Graham,” the
public must know it. S. A. Godman, of South Carolina,
has the following in his last week’s paper:</p>

<hr class='tbk186'/>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>The Best of the Monthlies.</span>”—We always have
had a partiality for <span class='sc'>Graham</span>. Years agone, before we
ever dreamed of inditing a line for the printer, many and
many are the pleasant hours we have spent, beguiled
from all surrounding things, by the captivating articles
with which <span class='sc'>Graham</span>, by an art known only to himself,
has for years past kept his Magazine—filled. In the
days of our juvenility, too, not a few thoughts have we
spent, wondering what manner of man he was, who
could thus monthly gather together such an amount of
valuable and interesting reading matter—to say nothing
of the choice embellishments that accompanied it.
And, in after times, when we had the pleasure of forming
his acquaintance, we found that the pictures of the
imagination had scarcely done justice, fairly drawn as
they were, to the original—for, than <span class='sc'>George R. Graham</span>,
there is not a more whole-souled, liberal, generous,
or enterprising man in the Union. With a kindness
that has no ebb, he is ever ready to appreciate
merit in the young, and by his means, and through his
encouragement, have some of the best authors that
America can now boast of been induced to launch their
barks—which since have made such successful voyages—upon
the sea of public opinion. His liberality,
too, keeps pace with his kindness—and instead of endeavoring
to underrate the value of brain-labor—he always
stretches his figures to the utmost limits of prudence—and
whilst he advises like a friend, he pays like a
prince. Success, then, say we, to <span class='sc'>Graham</span>, and his
Magazine! They both deserve it! And with a people
so prompt to perceive, and so ready to reward merit,
as are the inhabitants of the Southern States, to be
encouraged, it is only necessary to deserve encouragement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Graham’s</span> great rival now is Harper’s Magazine.
But the palm by rights, and all odds, belongs to the
former. For whilst his January number now lying before
us, is equal to Harper’s in the amount and quality
of its literary contents, it far exceeds it in beauty of
illustration—and in the fact that its contributors are all
honestly paid for their labors.”—<span class='it'>Illustrated Family
Friend, Columbia, S. C.</span></p>

<hr class='tbk187'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Graham’s Magazine.</span>—The January number of Graham
is incomparably the most magnificent periodical

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
